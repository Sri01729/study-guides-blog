This guide covers three important categories of Java operators:
- Assignment Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators

Each section is broken down with definitions, code examples, pitfalls, Spring Boot integration, and interview preparation.

# Assignment Operators

## Definition and Fundamentals
Assignment operators are used to **assign values** to variables. They form the backbone of **data manipulation** in Java programs.

**Where It Fits:** Core Java syntax, used in all Java programs.

**Core Principles:**
- Assignment happens from **right to left** (`=` operator).
- **Compound assignment operators** combine an operation with assignment (`+=`, `-=`, etc).

**When and Why to Use:**
Use when **initializing or updating** a variable's value.

---

## Code Examples

### Beginner Level
```java
int a = 5;
a += 3; // Equivalent to a = a + 3
System.out.println(a); // Output: 8
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
x *= y + 2; // x = x * (y + 2)
System.out.println(x); // Output: 220
```

### Advanced Level
```java
public class AtomicAssignment {
    private volatile int counter = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        counter += 1;
    }
}
```
*(Ensures **thread-safe assignment** in multi-threaded environments.)*

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake:** Forgetting that `x *= y + 2` means `x = x * (y + 2)`.
- **Performance Tip:** Avoid redundant assignments inside loops.
- **Security:** Validate inputs before assigning them.
- **Code Smell:** Overusing compound assignments reduces readability.

**Best Practice:** Always **prefer readability** over cleverness.

---

## Spring Boot Integration

**Use Case:** Setting configuration properties.

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
public class AppConfig {
    private String name = "DefaultName";

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

**Spring Enhancements:**
- Automatic binding using `@ConfigurationProperties` assigns external values to fields.

---

# Relational Operators

## Definition and Fundamentals
Relational operators **compare two values** and return a **boolean** (`true` or `false`).

**Where It Fits:** Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`), comparisons.

**Core Principles:**
- Includes `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

**When and Why to Use:**
**Decision-making** scenarios based on **data comparison**.

---

## Code Examples

### Beginner Level
```java
int a = 10, b = 20;
System.out.println(a < b); // true
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
String s1 = "hello";
String s2 = "hello";
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (but careful: it compares references)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true (value comparison)
```

### Advanced Level
```java
public class CustomComparator {
    public static boolean isOlderThan(int age, int threshold) {
        return age > threshold;
    }
}
```

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake:** Using `==` for comparing objects (use `.equals()`).
- **Performance:** Minimal impact.
- **Security:** Safe, but improper comparisons may lead to logical vulnerabilities.
- **Best Practice:** Always use `.equals()` for non-primitive types.

---

## Spring Boot Integration

**Use Case:** Conditional bean initialization.

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public MyService myService() {
    return new MyService();
}
```

**Spring Enhancements:**
- Conditional annotations depend on relational checks.

---

# Logical Operators

## Definition and Fundamentals
Logical operators are used to **combine multiple boolean expressions**.

**Where It Fits:** Control flow (e.g., `if`, `while`).

**Core Principles:**
- `&&` (AND)
- `||` (OR)
- `!` (NOT)

**When and Why to Use:**
Complex decision-making where multiple conditions must be evaluated.

---

## Code Examples

### Beginner Level
```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
System.out.println(a && b); // false
System.out.println(a || b); // true
System.out.println(!a);     // false
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
int age = 25;
boolean hasLicense = true;
if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
    System.out.println("Eligible to drive.");
}
```

### Advanced Level
```java
public class AccessValidator {
    public static boolean isValidUser(boolean isActive, boolean hasPermission) {
        return isActive && hasPermission;
    }
}
```

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake:** Using `&` instead of `&&` (no short-circuit evaluation).
- **Performance:** Prefer `&&`/`||` over `&`/`|` for better performance.
- **Security:** Incorrect logic can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Best Practice:**
  - Use parentheses `()` to clarify complex expressions.

---

## Spring Boot Integration

**Use Case:** Access Control with Method Security.

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') && hasAuthority('READ_PRIVILEGES')")
public String secureMethod() {
    return "Access granted";
}
```

**Spring Enhancements:**
- Logical conditions in `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, and `@Conditional` annotations.

# Interview Preparation

## Common Questions and Detailed Answers

### 1. What are assignment operators in Java?
**Answer:** Assignment operators are used to **assign values to variables**. The most common is `=`, which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. Compound assignments like `+=` and `*=` combine operations with assignment.

### 2. Explain the difference between `=` and `==` operators.
**Answer:** `=` is the **assignment operator** used to assign values. `==` is a **relational operator** used to compare primitive values (or object references).

### 3. What is the result of `x *= y + 2`?
**Answer:** It means `x = x * (y + 2)`, not `x = x * y + 2`. Parentheses matter.

### 4. How does Java handle string comparison?
**Answer:** Use `.equals()` for value comparison. `==` compares memory addresses.

### 5. What happens when you use `==` with objects?
**Answer:** It compares whether two object references point to the same memory location, not the actual contents.

### 6. Why should `.equals()` be preferred over `==` for objects?
**Answer:** Because `.equals()` compares the **contents** of objects, not just their memory addresses.

### 7. What are relational operators in Java?
**Answer:** Operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` that compare two values and return a boolean.

### 8. When would you use `<` and `<=` operators?
**Answer:** When you want to check if one value is **less than** or **less than or equal to** another.

### 9. How does short-circuit evaluation work in logical operators?
**Answer:** In `&&`, if the first operand is false, the second is not evaluated. In `||`, if the first operand is true, the second is not evaluated.

### 10. Difference between `&&` and `&`?
**Answer:** `&&` short-circuits and is faster; `&` always evaluates both sides.

### 11. When should you use `||` instead of `|`?
**Answer:** Prefer `||` when you want short-circuit behavior.

### 12. What happens if you misuse logical operators?
**Answer:** Logical errors or unnecessary evaluations that affect performance.

### 13. Explain logical NOT operator `!` with an example.
**Answer:** `!true` results in `false`. It negates the boolean value.

### 14. How can compound assignment improve code readability?
**Answer:** They make code shorter and often clearer (e.g., `x += 5` vs. `x = x + 5`).

### 15. When should you avoid using compound assignments?
**Answer:** When it reduces clarity in complex expressions.

### 16. Explain a real-world scenario where logical operators are crucial.
**Answer:** Checking login credentials (username exists AND password matches).

### 17. What is short-circuiting in logical operations?
**Answer:** Early termination of evaluation if the result can be determined.

### 18. How are relational operators used in Spring Boot configurations?
**Answer:** For conditional bean creation (`@ConditionalOnProperty`).

### 19. What is the impact of improper assignment inside loops?
**Answer:** Causes performance degradation due to unnecessary reassignments.

### 20. Give an example where logical operators prevent code execution.
**Answer:**
```java
if (user != null && user.isActive()) {
    process(user);
}
```
Avoids `NullPointerException`.

## Code Challenge

**Problem:**
```java
Write a Java method that checks if a given person can rent a car. The person must be older than 21 and must have a valid driving license.
```

**Solution:**
```java
public class RentalService {
    public static boolean canRentCar(int age, boolean hasLicense) {
        return age > 21 && hasLicense;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(canRentCar(22, true)); // true
        System.out.println(canRentCar(20, true)); // false
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Relational operator `>` checks age.
- Logical operator `&&` ensures both conditions must be `true`.
