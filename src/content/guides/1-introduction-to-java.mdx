# Introduction to Java

Java is a popular, versatile programming language known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability.

## Your First Java Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello World" program. Try running this code:

<PracticeSection
  title="Hello World"
  description="Run this code to see your first Java program in action!"
  language="java"
  defaultCode={`public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}`}
/>

## Variables and Data Types

Java is a statically-typed language, which means you need to declare the type of each variable. Here's an example:

<PracticeSection
  title="Variables and Data Types"
  description="Try modifying the values and see what happens!"
  language="java"
  defaultCode={`public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Integer types
        int number = 42;

        // Floating-point types
        double price = 19.99;

        // Character type
        char grade = 'A';

        // String type
        String name = "John";

        // Boolean type
        boolean isStudent = true;

        // Print all variables
        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        System.out.println("Price: $" + price);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Is student? " + isStudent);
    }
}`}
/>

## Basic Operations

Java supports various arithmetic operations. Try out some calculations:

<PracticeSection
  title="Basic Operations"
  description="Experiment with different mathematical operations:"
  language="java"
  defaultCode={`public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;

        // Basic arithmetic
        System.out.println("Addition: " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Division: " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("Modulus: " + (a % b));

        // Try changing these values!
    }
}`}
/>

Each practice section above includes an interactive code editor where you can:
1. Write and edit Java code
2. Format your code using the "Format Code" button
3. Run the code (once we implement the backend)
4. See the output below the editor

Feel free to experiment with the code examples and modify them to learn more about Java programming!
