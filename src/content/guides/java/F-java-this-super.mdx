# 1. `this` and `super` Methods

## Definition and Fundamentals

### `this`
- Refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
- Used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters, invoke current class methods, or constructors.

### `super`
- Refers to the immediate parent class object.
- Used to call parent class methods, constructors, or access hidden fields.

**Where it fits:** Core part of Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for handling inheritance and object reference.

**Core Principles:**
- Object referencing.
- Constructor chaining.
- Method overriding and polymorphism handling.

**When to use:**
- Avoid ambiguity.
- Invoke superclass behavior.
- Constructor chaining between parent-child classes.

---

# 2. Naming Conventions

## Definition and Fundamentals
- Set of rules followed for naming identifiers like classes, methods, variables, and packages.

**Where it fits:** Java coding standards and style guides.

**Core Principles:**
- Readability.
- Consistency.
- Maintenance.

**When to use:**
- Every time you write code (classes, methods, variables).

---

# 3. Anonymous Objects

## Definition and Fundamentals
- Objects created without explicitly naming a reference variable.

**Where it fits:**
- One-time use objects (especially in method calls).

**Core Principles:**
- Memory efficiency for short-lived objects.
- Simplification of code.

**When to use:**
- Quick usage, event handling, method chaining.

# Code Examples

## Beginner Level

### `this` Example
```java
class Employee {
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name; // Using 'this' to differentiate parameter and field
    }
}
```

### `super` Example
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // Calling parent class method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

### Naming Convention Example
```java
class CustomerData { // Class names are PascalCase
    private String firstName; // Variables are camelCase
}
```

### Anonymous Object Example
```java
new Employee("John").display();
```

---

## Intermediate Level

### Constructor Chaining
```java
class Person {
    Person() {
        System.out.println("Person constructor");
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    Student() {
        super();
        System.out.println("Student constructor");
    }
}
```

### Practical Anonymous Object
```java
public class Test {
    void show() { System.out.println("Hello World"); }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Test().show(); // Anonymous object
    }
}
```

---

## Advanced Level

### Advanced Constructor Usage
```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed;

    Vehicle(int speed) {
        this.speed = speed;
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car() {
        super(120);
    }
}
```

### Anonymous Object with Thread
```java
new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Thread running")).start();
```

# Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting `super()` call in subclass constructors.
- Using `this` unnecessarily, causing verbose code.
- Poor naming conventions leading to unreadable code.
- Overusing anonymous objects (memory leaks if not managed).

## Best Practices
- Always call `super()` first in constructors if required.
- Use `this` only to resolve ambiguity.
- Follow Java naming conventions (classes: PascalCase, variables/methods: camelCase).
- Use anonymous objects wisely (single-use).

# Real-World Spring Boot Integration

## Example: Using `this` and `super` in Spring Boot Entity Classes

```java
@Entity
public class Product extends BaseEntity {

    private String name;

    public Product(String name) {
        super(); // calling BaseEntity constructor
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `super()` ensures BaseEntity properties like `createdAt` are initialized.
- `this.name = name` initializes the Product field.

## Configuration Considerations
- Always prefer Lombok for cleaner constructors if possible in Spring Boot projects.

```java
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class Product {
    private String name;
}
```

# Interview Preparation

## 20 Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is the `this` keyword in Java?
- Refers to the current class instance.

### 2. Why do we use `this()` in constructors?
- To invoke another constructor in the same class.

### 3. What is `super` used for?
- To access parent class members.

### 4. Can `super` and `this` be used together?
- No, they must be the first statement in the constructor.

### 5. Explain constructor chaining with `this`.
- Calling another constructor within the same class.

### 6. Explain constructor chaining with `super`.
- Calling parent constructor from child constructor.

### 7. What happens if you don't call `super()` in a subclass constructor?
- The compiler adds `super()` automatically.

### 8. When would you override a method and still use `super`?
- When you want to extend the behavior, not completely replace it.

### 9. What is an anonymous object?
- An object without a named reference.

### 10. Where are anonymous objects commonly used?
- Event handling, method chaining.

### 11. What is the default constructor chain order?
- Parent constructor -> Child constructor.

### 12. Can you overload a constructor using `this()`?
- Yes, and it's common practice.

### 13. Why is naming convention important?
- Improves code readability and maintainability.

### 14. What are Java class naming rules?
- Start with uppercase, follow PascalCase.

### 15. What are Java variable naming rules?
- Start with lowercase, follow camelCase.

### 16. Can anonymous objects cause memory issues?
- Yes, if not garbage collected properly.

### 17. Can a constructor have both `this()` and `super()`?
- No, only one and it must be first.

### 18. What is the difference between `this.variable` and `variable`?
- `this.variable` explicitly refers to instance variables.

### 19. What is a common mistake when using `super`?
- Not calling `super()` in constructors that need parent initialization.

### 20. How do you ensure good naming practices in a team?
- Define coding standards and enforce reviews.

## Follow-up Questions
- Can you give an example where failing to use `super()` caused a bug?
- How does Spring Boot handle constructor injections using `this` or `super`?

## Code Challenges

### 1. Implement a parent and child class with constructor chaining
```java
class Parent {
    Parent() { System.out.println("Parent constructor"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super();
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Child();
    }
}
```

### 2. Create an anonymous object that prints "Hello Anonymous"
```java
new Object() {
    void print() { System.out.println("Hello Anonymous"); }
}.print();
```

# Conclusion
Understanding `this`, `super`, naming conventions, and anonymous objects is foundational to writing clear, robust, and scalable Java applications, especially when integrating with Spring Boot ecosystems. Mastering these concepts will significantly enhance both your coding practices and your performance in technical interviews.
