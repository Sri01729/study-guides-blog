## 1. Object Class, equals(), toString(), hashCode()

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **Object Class** is the root class of the Java class hierarchy. Every class implicitly extends `java.lang.Object` if no superclass is explicitly defined.
- **equals()**: Used to compare two objects for equality.
- **toString()**: Returns a string representation of an object.
- **hashCode()**: Returns an integer hash code representation of the object.

### Where it fits in the Java Ecosystem
- Foundation of all Java classes.
- Crucial for collections (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.), debugging, and identity comparison.

### Core Principles and Background
- Contracts between `equals()` and `hashCode()` must be maintained.
- `toString()` helps in logging and debugging.

### When and Why to Use
- Override when you need custom comparison or string representations.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level:**
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Person p = new Person("John");
System.out.println(p.toString()); // default Object@hashcode
```

**Intermediate Level:**
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    Person person = (Person) o;
    return Objects.equals(name, person.name);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name);
}

@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Person{name='" + name + "'}";
}
```

**Advanced Level:**
```java
// Immutable class with proper equals and hashCode contract
public final class ImmutablePerson {
    private final String name;

    public ImmutablePerson(String name) {
        this.name = Objects.requireNonNull(name);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof ImmutablePerson)) return false;
        ImmutablePerson that = (ImmutablePerson) o;
        return name.equals(that.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return name.hashCode();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("ImmutablePerson{name='%s'}", name);
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake**: Not overriding `hashCode()` when overriding `equals()`.
- **Best Practice**: Always override both together.
- **Performance**: Poor `hashCode()` can cause hash collisions.

## 2. Upcasting and Downcasting

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **Upcasting**: Casting a subclass object to a superclass reference.
- **Downcasting**: Casting a superclass reference back to a subclass reference.

### Where it fits
- Polymorphism, Collections, dynamic binding.

### Core Principles
- Upcasting is safe and implicit.
- Downcasting must be done carefully and explicitly.

### When and Why to Use
- Upcasting for generalization.
- Downcasting for accessing specific behaviors.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level:**
```java
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting
```

**Intermediate Level:**
```java
if (a instanceof Dog) {
    Dog d = (Dog) a; // Downcasting safely
}
```

**Advanced Level:**
```java
// Method demonstrating polymorphism
void makeSound(Animal animal) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog dog) { // Java 17 Pattern Matching
        dog.bark();
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake**: Unsafe downcasting causes `ClassCastException`.
- **Best Practice**: Always check using `instanceof`.

---

## 3. Abstract Keyword

### Definition and Fundamentals
- Used to declare a class that cannot be instantiated directly or a method without a body.

### Where it fits
- Foundation for polymorphic hierarchies.
- Template methods in design patterns.

### Core Principles
- An abstract class may contain abstract and concrete methods.
- Child classes must implement abstract methods.

### When and Why to Use
- Common functionality in parent, specific behavior in child.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level:**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}
```

**Intermediate Level:**
```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

Animal animal = new Dog();
animal.makeSound();
```

**Advanced Level:**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    private final double radius;
    Circle(double radius) { this.radius = radius; }

    @Override
    double area() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake**: Trying to instantiate an abstract class.
- **Best Practice**: Use abstract classes for base templates and interfaces for multiple inheritances.

# Real-World Spring Boot Integration

### Example: Abstract Base Controller for CRUD Operations

```java
public abstract class AbstractCrudController<T> {

    public abstract List<T> findAll();

    public abstract T findById(Long id);

    public abstract T save(T entity);
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController extends AbstractCrudController<User> {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @Override
    public List<User> findAll() {
        return userService.findAll();
    }

    @Override
    public User findById(Long id) {
        return userService.findById(id);
    }

    @Override
    public User save(User user) {
        return userService.save(user);
    }
}
```

**Spring Boot Enhancements:**
- Spring Dependency Injection for services.
- `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping` for REST APIs.

# Interview Preparation

## Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is the Object class?**
   > The Object class is the parent of all Java classes. It provides essential methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`, which help define object identity and behavior.

2. **Why should you override `equals()` and `hashCode()` together?**
   > Collections like HashMap and HashSet depend on both methods. If you override `equals()`, you must override `hashCode()` to maintain consistency when objects are stored or retrieved from a collection.

3. **What happens if you don't override `hashCode()`?**
   > Objects that are logically equal might end up in different buckets in a hash-based collection, causing unexpected behavior.

4. **What is the use of `toString()`?**
   > Provides a string representation of an object, mainly used for debugging or logging.

5. **What is upcasting?**
   > Upcasting is casting a child class object to a parent class reference. It is safe and implicit.

6. **What is downcasting?**
   > Downcasting is casting a parent class reference back to a child class. It must be explicit and requires careful checking.

7. **When do you use `instanceof` in Java?**
   > To check an objectâ€™s type before downcasting it, avoiding `ClassCastException`.

8. **Is upcasting safe?**
   > Yes, upcasting is safe because the child class object "is-a" parent class object.

9. **What are the risks with downcasting?**
   > If the actual object isn't of the target subclass, a `ClassCastException` occurs at runtime.

10. **What is an abstract class?**
    > A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.

11. **Difference between abstract class and interface?**
    > Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods; interface traditionally had only abstract methods (before Java 8). Interfaces are used for multiple inheritance.

12. **Can an abstract class have constructors?**
    > Yes, abstract classes can have constructors to initialize common properties.

13. **Can an abstract class have a main method?**
    > Yes, abstract classes can have a `main()` method.

14. **Why can't we instantiate abstract classes?**
    > Abstract classes are incomplete by design and require concrete implementations.

15. **Can an abstract class have a final method?**
    > Yes, an abstract class can have a final method. It cannot be overridden by subclasses.

16. **Why override `toString()`?**
    > To provide a meaningful description of the object for debugging, logging, and better readability.

17. **How does `equals()` relate to `==` operator?**
    > `==` compares references (memory addresses); `equals()` compares logical equality of objects.

18. **What happens if we use a wrong `hashCode()`?**
    > It leads to inefficient hashing in collections, causing performance degradation.

19. **How do Spring Boot repositories use upcasting?**
    > Spring Data repositories often upcast specific entities to generic interfaces like `JpaRepository`, promoting loose coupling.

20. **How can abstract classes be used in Spring Boot APIs?**
    > Abstract classes can define common controller behaviors or service methods, which specific implementations extend.


## Code Challenges

**Challenge 1: Create an abstract class Animal with two child classes Cat and Dog. Each should implement a method `makeSound()`.**

**Solution:**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void makeSound() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
```

**Challenge 2: Write equals() and hashCode() for a class Car with properties make and model.**

**Solution:**
```java
class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Car car = (Car) o;
        return Objects.equals(make, car.make) && Objects.equals(model, car.model);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(make, model);
    }
}
```
