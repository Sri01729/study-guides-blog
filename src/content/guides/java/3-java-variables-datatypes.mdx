## Definition and Fundamentals
Variables are named memory locations used to store data temporarily during program execution.
- **Fits into**: Core Java Language Basics
- **Core Principles**:
  - Must be declared before use
  - Have a data type and a name

**When to Use**: Any time you need to store and manipulate data.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

**Beginner:**
```java
int age = 25;
System.out.println(age);
```

**Intermediate:**
```java
String name = "Alice";
int birthYear = 1995;
System.out.println(name + " was born in " + birthYear);
```

**Advanced:**
```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
System.out.println("Value of Pi: " + PI);
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistakes**:
  - Using variables before initializing.
  - Bad naming conventions (e.g., `a`, `b`, `data1`).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Meaningful names (`userAge`, `productPrice`).
  - Use `final` for constants.

## Real-World Spring Boot Integration
```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    private String defaultRole = "USER";

    public String getDefaultRole() {
        return defaultRole;
    }
}
```

**Spring Boot Enhancements**:
- Use `@Value` to inject variables from `application.properties`.

```java
@Value("${app.default-role}")
private String defaultRole;
```

# Data Types in Java

## Definition and Fundamentals
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold.
- **Primitive types**: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Reference types**: `String`, arrays, objects.

**When to Use**: To specify the kind of data you want to work with for memory efficiency and correctness.

## Code Examples

**Beginner:**
```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
char grade = 'A';
```

**Intermediate:**
```java
int[] scores = {90, 85, 80};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(scores));
```

**Advanced:**
```java
Map<String, Integer> employeeAge = new HashMap<>();
employeeAge.put("John", 30);
```

## Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistakes**:
  - Wrong choice of types (e.g., using `float` instead of `double`).
  - Forgetting array indices start at 0.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use wrappers (`Integer`, `Boolean`) if objects are needed.

## Spring Boot Integration

DTO classes use data types heavily:
```java
public class UserDTO {
    private String username;
    private int age;
}
```

# Literals in Java

## Definition and Fundamentals
Literals are fixed values assigned directly to variables.
- **Examples**:
  - Integer literal: `10`
  - Floating-point literal: `10.5`
  - Character literal: `'a'`
  - String literal: `"Hello"`

**When to Use**: Whenever assigning a hardcoded value.

## Code Examples

**Beginner:**
```java
int number = 100;
```

**Intermediate:**
```java
char letter = 'Z';
String greeting = "Welcome";
```

**Advanced:**
```java
long bigNumber = 123_456_789L; // Readable big numbers
```

## Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistakes**:
  - Missing suffixes (`L` for long, `F` for float).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use underscores for readability in large numbers.

## Spring Boot Integration
Application properties as literals:
```
server.port=8080
```
Injected via:
```java
@Value("${server.port}")
private int serverPort;
```

# Type Conversion in Java

## Definition and Fundamentals
Type Conversion is changing a variable from one type to another.
- **Implicit (Widening)**: Done automatically.
- **Explicit (Narrowing)**: Must be done manually.

**When to Use**: When operations involve mixed data types.

## Code Examples

**Beginner:**
```java
int num = 10;
double dbl = num; // Widening (Implicit)
```

**Intermediate:**
```java
double price = 99.99;
int roundedPrice = (int) price; // Narrowing (Explicit)
```

**Advanced:**
```java
String str = "123";
int parsedNumber = Integer.parseInt(str);
```

## Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistakes**:
  - Data loss during narrowing.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always check if narrowing conversion will cause data loss.

## Spring Boot Integration
Binding properties automatically converts types:
```java
@Value("${app.max-users}")
private int maxUsers;
```
Spring auto-converts string `"100"` to integer `100`.

# Interview Preparation

### 20 Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is a variable in Java?**
   > A variable is a container that holds data during program execution. For example, `int age = 25;` stores the value `25`.

2. **Different types of variables in Java?**
   > Local, Instance, Static variables.

3. **What are data types?**
   > Data types specify the type of data a variable holds, like `int`, `char`, `boolean`.

4. **Difference between primitive and reference data types?**
   > Primitive hold actual value, reference holds address.

5. **What is a literal?**
   > Fixed value assigned to a variable directly, like `5` or `'c'`.

6. **Examples of literals?**
   > `123`, `"Hello"`, `'A'`, `3.14F`.

7. **What is type casting?**
   > Changing one data type to another, e.g., `(int) 99.99`.

8. **Implicit vs Explicit type conversion?**
   > Implicit: Automatic (int to double); Explicit: Manual (double to int).

9. **What happens in narrowing conversion?**
   > Possible data loss.

10. **Can `null` be assigned to a primitive type?**
    > No.

11. **Default value of int?**
    > `0`

12. **What is the size of a char?**
    > 2 bytes (UTF-16)

13. **Difference between float and double?**
    > `float` (32-bit), `double` (64-bit, more precision)

14. **Why is String not primitive?**
    > It's an object in Java.

15. **What is wrapper class?**
    > Object representation of primitive types like `Integer`, `Double`.

16. **Can you change the value of a final variable?**
    > No.

17. **What is a symbolic constant?**
    > Final variables that act like constants.

18. **Why prefer meaningful variable names?**
    > Improves code readability and maintenance.

19. **Explain `@Value` in Spring Boot.**
    > Used to inject literal values into fields.

20. **When is explicit type casting required?**
    > When narrowing conversions happen (e.g., double to int).

### Follow-up Questions Interviewers Might Ask
- What happens when a narrowing conversion overflows?
- How do you handle parsing errors during type conversion?
- Why use wrapper classes over primitives sometimes?

### Code Challenge Related to These Topics

**Problem:** Write a Java method that accepts a double, converts it to int, and returns the int multiplied by 2.

**Solution:**
```java
public int doubleToIntAndMultiply(double value) {
    int intValue = (int) value;
    return intValue * 2;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Explicit cast from double to int.
- Arithmetic operation after type conversion.

### How to Demonstrate Deep Understanding
- Discuss memory layout differences between primitives and references.
- Mention auto-boxing and unboxing when using wrappers.
- Talk about real-world use like config binding in Spring Boot.
