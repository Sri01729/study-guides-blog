# Advanced Java: Stream API and Related Concepts

---

## Need of Stream API

### Definition and Fundamentals
**Stream API** in Java provides a functional-style approach to processing sequences of elements. Introduced in Java 8, it allows for efficient and readable data manipulation through pipelines.

**Where it fits**: Java Collections Framework enhancement.

**Core principles**:
- Functional programming
- Lazy evaluation
- Internal iteration (vs external iteration)

**When and why**:
- To perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing on data in a clean and optimized way.
- Ideal for complex data transformation and aggregation tasks.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level**
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .forEach(System.out::println);
```

**Intermediate Level**
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack", "Doe");
List<String> upperNames = names.stream()
                               .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
                               .map(String::toUpperCase)
                               .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(upperNames);
```

**Advanced Level**
```java
List<Employee> employees = fetchEmployees();
Map<String, Double> averageSalaryByDepartment = employees.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
             Collectors.averagingDouble(Employee::getSalary)));
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

**Pitfalls**:
- Using streams for side-effects (e.g., modifying external state).
- Not closing streams sourced from IO.
- Forgetting terminal operations (streams won't execute without them).

**Best Practices**:
- Keep pipelines short and readable.
- Prefer method references (`Class::method`) where possible.
- Be mindful of performance when chaining multiple operations.

---

## forEach Method

### Definition and Fundamentals
`forEach` is a terminal operation that applies a given action to each element of the stream.

**Where it fits**: Terminal operation in the Stream API.

**Core principles**:
- Consumer functional interface.
- No return value (void).

**When and why**:
- To apply an action on each element without collecting them into a collection.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level**
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
list.forEach(System.out::println);
```

**Intermediate Level**
```java
Map<String, Integer> items = Map.of("apple", 3, "banana", 2);
items.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println(k + ":" + v));
```

**Advanced Level**
```java
List<Employee> employees = fetchEmployees();
employees.parallelStream().forEach(employee -> processEmployee(employee));
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

**Pitfalls**:
- Modifying the source collection while iterating.
- Misusing `forEach` for transformations instead of mapping.

**Best Practices**:
- Use `forEach` for actions, not for building new collections.
- Be cautious with `parallelStream` and shared mutable state.

## Stream API Concepts: Map, Filter, Reduce, Sorted

### Definitions and Fundamentals

- **map()**: Transforms each element.
- **filter()**: Selects elements based on a condition.
- **reduce()**: Aggregates elements into a single result.
- **sorted()**: Sorts elements.

**Where they fit**: Intermediate operations.

**Core principles**:
- Pure functions.
- Lazy execution.

**When and why**:
- `map` for data transformation
- `filter` for data selection
- `reduce` for data aggregation
- `sorted` for ordered output

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level**
```java
List<String> items = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
List<String> upper = items.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**Intermediate Level**
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
System.out.println(sum);
```

**Advanced Level**
```java
List<Employee> employees = fetchEmployees();
List<String> sortedNames = employees.stream()
    .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 50000)
    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName))
    .map(Employee::getName)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

**Pitfalls**:
- Using heavy computations inside `map`.
- Forgetting that `reduce` needs an identity value.

**Best Practices**:
- Keep mapping functions pure.
- Choose the correct overload of `reduce`.
- Avoid unnecessary sorting if the collection is already sorted.

## Real-World Spring Boot Integration Example

**Problem**: List all employees with salary > 60k in alphabetical order.

**Controller**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @GetMapping("/high-earners")
    public List<String> getHighEarners() {
        return employeeRepository.findAll().stream()
                .filter(emp -> emp.getSalary() > 60000)
                .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName))
                .map(Employee::getName)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

**Repository**
```java
@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {}
```

**Spring Boot Enhancements**:
- `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`
- Dependency Injection with `@Autowired`
- JPA repository abstraction

## Interview Preparation

### 20 Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is the Stream API in Java?**
   > A modern way to process collections using a pipeline of operations like filter, map, and reduce.

2. **Why was the Stream API introduced?**
   > To bring functional programming concepts to Java and to process data efficiently.

3. **What is internal vs external iteration?**
   > Internal: Handled by Stream API. External: Traditional for-loops.

4. **Difference between map() and flatMap()?**
   > `map` transforms elements individually, `flatMap` flattens nested structures.

5. **Can streams be reused?**
   > No, streams are consumable and cannot be reused after a terminal operation.

6. **Is Stream API lazy?**
   > Yes, intermediate operations are lazy.

7. **What are terminal operations?**
   > Operations like forEach, collect, reduce that end the stream pipeline.

8. **What is reduce()?**
   > Aggregates stream elements into a single value.

9. **Explain filter().**
   > Filters stream elements based on a predicate.

10. **How to create a Stream from a Collection?**
    > `collection.stream()`

11. **How to parallelize Stream operations?**
    > Using `parallelStream()`

12. **Are Streams thread-safe?**
    > No, unless managed properly or using parallel streams with stateless operations.

13. **How do you sort elements in Stream?**
    > Using `sorted()` with or without Comparator.

14. **Best practice for heavy computation inside Streams?**
    > Avoid it. Preprocess if needed.

15. **What's collect()?**
    > A terminal operation to gather results into a list, set, map, etc.

16. **How does forEach differ from traditional for-loops?**
    > forEach abstracts iteration and works on Streams.

17. **Difference between collect() and reduce()?**
    > `collect` is mutable reduction, `reduce` is immutable aggregation.

18. **What is the advantage of Streams over loops?**
    > Better readability, laziness, and potential parallelism.

19. **Explain short-circuiting in Streams.**
    > Operations like `anyMatch`, `findFirst` terminate early.

20. **How does lazy evaluation work in Streams?**
    > Intermediate operations wait until a terminal operation is invoked.

### Follow-Up Questions
- How would you handle exceptions inside Streams?
- When would you prefer a traditional loop over a Stream?
- Can you implement a custom collector?

### Code Challenges

**Challenge**: Given a list of strings, return the first non-repeating character.

**Solution**
```java
Optional<Character> result = strings.stream()
    .flatMapToInt(String::chars)
    .mapToObj(c -> (char) c)
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(c -> c, LinkedHashMap::new, Collectors.counting()))
    .entrySet()
    .stream()
    .filter(entry -> entry.getValue() == 1)
    .map(Map.Entry::getKey)
    .findFirst();
```

**Explanation**:
- Flatten characters
- Group by character with count
- Filter by count == 1
- Get the first such character

### How to demonstrate deep understanding
- Explain how lazy evaluation improves performance.
- Mention how Streams allow better multi-core utilization (via `parallelStream`).
- Show awareness of pitfalls like shared mutable state with `parallelStream`.
