## Definition and Fundamentals

**Threads** are the smallest unit of execution within a process. In Java, they allow concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program to maximize CPU utilization.

- **Where it fits**: Core Java concurrency package (`java.lang.Thread`)
- **Core Principle**: Parallelism and multitasking.
- **Why use**: To make programs faster, more responsive, and better utilize multi-core systems.

## Code Examples

### Beginner
```java
public class HelloThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from thread!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HelloThread thread = new HelloThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Intermediate
```java
class PrintTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new PrintTask());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new PrintTask());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### Advanced
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SafeCounter {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Mistakes**:
  - Forgetting `start()` vs `run()` confusion.
  - Not handling synchronization leading to race conditions.
  - Creating too many threads (leading to resource exhaustion).

- **Performance**:
  - Prefer thread pooling using `ExecutorService`.

- **Security**:
  - Avoid leaking sensitive data between threads.

- **Code Smells**:
  - Busy-wait loops.

- **Modern Best Practices**:
  - Use `ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture`, or parallel streams instead of manually creating threads.

## Real-World Spring Boot Integration

**Business Problem**: Asynchronously processing user registration emails.

### Spring Boot Example
```java
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmailService {

    @Async
    public void sendRegistrationEmail(String email) {
        System.out.println("Sending email to: " + email);
    }
}
```

### Configuration
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync;

@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncConfig {
}
```

**How Spring Boot enhances**:
- Abstracts thread creation.
- Automatically handles thread pools with simple annotations.

# Java: Multiple Threads

## Definition and Fundamentals
Running multiple threads concurrently to perform different tasks simultaneously.

**Example**: UI thread + background loading thread.

### Code Example
```java
public class MultiThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Task 1"));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Task 2"));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

---

# Thread Priority and Sleep

## Definition

- **Priority**: Determines the preference a thread gets from the CPU.
- **Sleep**: Temporarily pauses a thread.

### Example
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Running thread..."));
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
t.start();

Thread.sleep(1000); // Pauses for 1 second
```

---

# Runnable vs Thread

## Differences

| Runnable | Thread |
|:--------:|:------:|
| Interface | Class |
| Can extend another class | Cannot extend another class |
| Preferable for flexibility | Limited |

**Best Practice**: Always prefer `Runnable`.

### Example
```java
class Task implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable task running");
    }
}
```

---

# Race Condition

## Definition

A **race condition** occurs when multiple threads access shared data and try to change it simultaneously.

**Problem**: Unpredictable results.

### Example (Bad)
```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

**Fixed**:
```java
synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}
```

---

# Thread States

## Definition

Java thread lifecycle:

1. **New**
2. **Runnable**
3. **Blocked**
4. **Waiting**
5. **Timed Waiting**
6. **Terminated**

### Code Example
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {});
System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW

 t.start();
System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE
```

---

# Java Threads - Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is a Thread in Java?
**Answer**: A thread is a lightweight process. It's a separate path of execution within a program that enables concurrent operations.

> **Follow-up**: How are threads different from processes?

## 2. How do you create a Thread in Java?
**Answer**:
- Extend the `Thread` class and override the `run()` method.
- Implement the `Runnable` interface and pass it to a `Thread` object.

> **Follow-up**: Which method is better and why?

## 3. Difference between `start()` and `run()` methods?
**Answer**:
- `start()`: Creates a new thread and calls `run()` internally.
- `run()`: Just a normal method call, no new thread is created.

> **Follow-up**: What happens if you call `run()` directly?

## 4. What is Runnable?
**Answer**: Runnable is a functional interface in Java that represents a task that can be executed concurrently.

## 5. Thread vs Runnable - Which is better?
**Answer**: Runnable is preferred because Java supports single inheritance, and implementing Runnable allows a class to inherit from another class.

> **Follow-up**: When would you use Thread directly?

## 6. Explain thread states.
**Answer**:
- New
- Runnable
- Blocked
- Waiting
- Timed Waiting
- Terminated

> **Follow-up**: What causes a thread to move from Runnable to Blocked?

## 7. What is Synchronization?
**Answer**: Synchronization ensures that only one thread accesses a critical section at a time, preventing data inconsistency.

> **Follow-up**: How does intrinsic locking work?

## 8. What is Deadlock?
**Answer**: A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock.

> **Follow-up**: How can you prevent deadlock?

## 9. What is a Race Condition?
**Answer**: When multiple threads access and modify shared data at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.

> **Follow-up**: Name real-world examples of race conditions.

## 10. How do you solve Race Conditions?
**Answer**: By using synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, or atomic classes like `AtomicInteger`.

## 11. What is Thread Priority?
**Answer**: Threads in Java can have priority levels (1 to 10) that hint to the scheduler which thread to prefer.

> **Follow-up**: Does setting a higher priority guarantee faster execution?

## 12. How does `Thread.sleep()` work?
**Answer**: It pauses the thread for a specified time without releasing any locks it holds.

> **Follow-up**: Does sleep() guarantee exact pause time?

## 13. What is `join()` method?
**Answer**: `join()` causes the current thread to wait until another thread finishes its execution.

> **Follow-up**: What happens if join is called on a dead thread?

## 14. How to create thread-safe code?
**Answer**: By synchronizing critical sections, using concurrent collections, or leveraging atomic variables.

## 15. What are Daemon Threads?
**Answer**: Background threads that don't prevent JVM shutdown.

> **Follow-up**: How to create a daemon thread?

## 16. What happens if we call `run()` directly instead of `start()`?
**Answer**: It will execute in the same thread, not a new thread.

## 17. How to handle thread exceptions?
**Answer**: Use `Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler()` to handle uncaught exceptions.

> **Follow-up**: How does it differ from normal exception handling?

## 18. How to stop a thread gracefully?
**Answer**: By using a volatile flag to signal the thread to stop rather than calling `Thread.stop()` (which is deprecated).

> **Follow-up**: Why was `Thread.stop()` deprecated?

## 19. What is ThreadPool?
**Answer**: A collection of reusable threads to execute tasks, managed by frameworks like `ExecutorService`.

> **Follow-up**: How is it better than manually creating threads?

## 20. What is `ExecutorService`?
**Answer**: It provides a higher-level replacement for managing threads, tasks, and thread pools.

> **Follow-up**: What are some important ExecutorService implementations?

# Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: Simple Counter
**Problem**: Create a counter incremented by 2 threads safely.

**Solution**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final Counter Value: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

## Challenge 2: Deadlock Example

**Problem**: Demonstrate deadlock situation.

**Solution**:
```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object Lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object Lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (Lock1) {
                try { Thread.sleep(50); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (Lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired both locks");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (Lock2) {
                try { Thread.sleep(50); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (Lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired both locks");
                }
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

**How to avoid**:
- Always acquire locks in the same order.
- Use tryLock with timeout.

# How to Demonstrate Deep Understanding

- Mention Java Memory Model (JMM) when discussing concurrency.
- Discuss ReentrantLocks vs synchronized blocks.
- Explain thread starvation and livelock.
- Bring real-world business problems and how threading solved them.

# Java Concurrency Best Practices Cheat Sheet

## Core Principles

- **Minimize Thread Creation**: Threads are expensive. Prefer reusing threads (e.g., `ExecutorService`).
- **Prefer Immutability**: Immutable objects are automatically thread-safe.
- **Use Higher-Level Concurrency Utilities**: Prefer `ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`, etc.
- **Minimize Lock Scope**: Keep synchronized blocks as short as possible.
- **Avoid Busy Waiting**: Use wait/notify or higher-level constructs.
- **Prefer synchronized blocks/methods over synchronized classes**: Fine-grained locking improves scalability.

---

## Thread Creation

| **Bad** | **Good** |
|:------:|:--------:|
| new Thread().start() | Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n) |

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task running"));
```

---

## Synchronization

- Use **synchronized** for atomic operations:
```java
synchronized(lockObject) {
    // critical section
}
```
- Use `ReentrantLock` when you need more control (e.g., tryLock, fairness).

---

## Volatile Keyword

- Use `volatile` when multiple threads are reading/writing a **single variable** without compound actions.
```java
private volatile boolean running = true;
```

---

## Avoid Deadlocks

- Always acquire locks in a **consistent order**.
- Prefer using `tryLock(timeout)` where possible.

---

## ExecutorService Shutdown

Always shut down your executors gracefully:
```java
executor.shutdown();
try {
    if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        executor.shutdownNow();
    }
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    executor.shutdownNow();
}
```

---

## Thread Safety Utilities

- Atomic variables: `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`
- Concurrent collections: `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
- Thread-safe counters: `LongAdder` for high-contention counters

---

## Handling Exceptions in Threads

- Use `Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler()`:
```java
Thread t = new Thread(task);
t.setUncaughtExceptionHandler((thread, ex) -> System.out.println("Error: " + ex));
t.start();
```

---

## Daemon Threads

- For background tasks that should not block JVM shutdown:
```java
Thread t = new Thread(task);
t.setDaemon(true);
t.start();
```

---

## Common Concurrency Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Better Approach |
|:------------:|:---------------:|
| Creating threads manually everywhere | Use thread pools |
| Using synchronized on large methods | Fine-grained synchronization |
| Ignoring exception handling in threads | Always catch/log exceptions |
| Deadlock-prone nested locks | Consistent lock order / tryLock |

---

## Quick Summary Table

| Concept | Best Practice |
|:-------:|:-------------:|
| Thread Creation | ExecutorService |
| Synchronization | Short synchronized blocks |
| Shared Variables | Use volatile/atomic types |
| Race Conditions | Synchronization/Locks |
| Deadlock Prevention | Lock ordering/tryLock |
| Exception Handling | UncaughtExceptionHandler |

---

# Final Tip 🎯

> **Think in terms of tasks, not threads.**
>
> Design your code to submit units of work to an executor rather than managing threads manually.
