## Definition and Fundamentals

**Encapsulation** is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (alongside Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction).

- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components to enforce controlled access via getters and setters.

- **Where it fits in Java**: Core to Java's OOP design principles. Java supports encapsulation using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`, default) and getter/setter methods.

- **Core Principles**:
  - Hide internal state and require all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
  - Improve code maintainability and flexibility.
  - Control over data: validate data before updating.

- **When and why to use**:
  - Protect sensitive data.
  - Improve reusability.
  - Enhance security and integrity of objects.
  - Allow modular, manageable code evolution.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner Level

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("Alice");
        System.out.println(person.getName());
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Level

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

### Advanced Level

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ThreadSafeAccount {
    private double balance;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public double getBalance() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return balance;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (amount > 0) {
                balance += amount;
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {
                balance -= amount;
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Common Mistakes
- Making fields `public` directly.
- Skipping validation in setters.
- Overusing getters/setters without real encapsulation.

### Performance Implications
- Minimal direct performance impact.
- Significant long-term maintainability benefit.

### Security Considerations
- Proper encapsulation protects against accidental or malicious changes to internal data.

### Code Smells and Anti-Patterns
- Anemic Domain Model: Only getters/setters without logic.

### Best Practices
- Always make fields `private`.
- Provide public/protected getters and setters only when needed.
- Validate input inside setters.

## Real-World Spring Boot Integration

### Practical Example
Imagine a Spring Boot application managing Employees.

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private double salary;

    // Getters and Setters
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        if(name == null || name.isBlank()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be blank");
        }
        this.name = name;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        if(salary < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Salary cannot be negative");
        }
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

**Spring Boot Leverages Encapsulation**:
- JPA Entities require encapsulation for persistence.
- Validation can be integrated using Bean Validation (Hibernate Validator).
- Example: `@NotNull`, `@Positive` annotations.

### Configuration Considerations
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to expose only necessary fields when transferring objects.


## Interview Preparation

### 20 Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is encapsulation?**
   - Encapsulation is wrapping data and behavior into a single unit and controlling access using access modifiers.

2. **How is encapsulation achieved in Java?**
   - Using `private` fields with `public` getters and setters.

3. **Why is encapsulation important?**
   - It provides control, security, and modularity.

4. **What are the advantages of encapsulation?**
   - Data hiding, increased flexibility, ease of maintenance.

5. **Can you have a class without encapsulation?**
   - Yes, but it would expose internal states, making it prone to errors.

6. **Is encapsulation the same as abstraction?**
   - No. Encapsulation hides data; abstraction hides complexity.

7. **Give an example where encapsulation failed?**
   - Making fields `public` exposes internal representation.

8. **What is a JavaBean and how is it related to encapsulation?**
   - JavaBean follows strict encapsulation: private properties with public getters/setters.

9. **Difference between public and private fields?**
   - Public fields are accessible from anywhere; private fields are accessible only within the class.

10. **How can you make a class immutable using encapsulation?**
    - Make fields `final` and `private`, and do not provide setters.

11. **What role do access modifiers play in encapsulation?**
    - They control visibility and access levels.

12. **How to validate encapsulated data?**
    - Perform checks inside setters.

13. **What is a DTO and how does it relate to encapsulation?**
    - DTOs expose only necessary data for transfer, promoting encapsulation.

14. **How does encapsulation promote security?**
    - It prevents unauthorized modification of object state.

15. **Explain encapsulation with a bank account example.**
    - Protecting balance by using methods to deposit and withdraw instead of directly modifying it.

16. **Can encapsulation lead to performance issues?**
    - Rarely; performance cost is negligible compared to benefits.

17. **Is encapsulation mandatory in Java?**
    - Not enforced by language, but strongly recommended.

18. **Can encapsulation be broken?**
    - Yes, via reflection (but usually controlled or restricted).

19. **How does Spring Boot utilize encapsulation?**
    - Through JPA Entities, Validation Annotations, Controllers exposing only DTOs.

20. **Explain encapsulation vs information hiding.**
    - Encapsulation implements information hiding.

### Follow-Up Questions
- How does encapsulation help in multithreaded programming?
- How would you design a thread-safe encapsulated class?
- How do Lombok annotations affect encapsulation?

### Code Challenge

**Problem**: Create a class `Product` that has `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. Ensure:
- `price` and `quantity` cannot be negative.
- Provide methods to update them safely.

```java
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int quantity;

    public Product(String name, double price, int quantity) {
        this.name = name;
        setPrice(price);
        setQuantity(quantity);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        if (price < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Price cannot be negative");
        }
        this.price = price;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
        if (quantity < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Quantity cannot be negative");
        }
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
}
```

**Solution Explanation**:
- Validations are done inside setters.
- Direct field manipulation is avoided.
- Constructor uses setters to ensure validation at object creation.

### How to Demonstrate Deep Understanding
- Mention importance of validation and thread safety.
- Emphasize the use of DTOs in real-world projects.
- Talk about reflection and security considerations.
- Connect encapsulation with design patterns like Builder Pattern.
