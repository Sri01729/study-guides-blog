## 1. Need for Loop

### Definition and Fundamentals

Loops allow repeated execution of a block of code based on a condition. They are fundamental to controlling program flow, reducing redundancy, and handling repetitive tasks automatically.

**Fits In Java Ecosystem:**

- Fundamental in control flow mechanisms.
- Used in data processing, iteration over arrays/collections.

**Core Principles:**

- Initialization
- Condition Checking
- Execution
- Update (Iteration)

**When and Why to Use:**

- When you need to perform repetitive tasks like traversing arrays, user inputs, or retry mechanisms.

---

## 2. While Loop

### Definition and Fundamentals

Executes a block of code **as long as** the specified condition is `true`.

**Syntax:**

```java
while (condition) {
    // code block
}
```

**Where it fits:**

- Situations where the number of iterations is **not known** beforehand.

**Core Principle:**

- Checks condition **before** executing the loop.

**When to Use:**

- Reading inputs until a user quits.
- Continuously waiting for an external event.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level:**

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

**Intermediate Level:**

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String input;
while (!(input = sc.nextLine()).equals("exit")) {
    System.out.println("You entered: " + input);
}
```

**Advanced Level:**

```java
AtomicBoolean running = new AtomicBoolean(true);
while (running.get()) {
    // Perform thread-safe tasks
    if (shouldStop()) {
        running.set(false);
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Pitfall:** Infinite loops without exit conditions.
- **Best Practice:** Always ensure loop termination logic.
- **Performance:** Avoid expensive computations inside condition checks.

---

## 3. Do-While Loop

### Definition and Fundamentals

Executes the block of code **once**, **then** checks the condition.

**Syntax:**

```java
do {
    // code block
} while (condition);
```

**Where it fits:**

- When the block **must execute at least once**.

**Core Principle:**

- **Post-Condition** check.

**When to Use:**

- Menu-driven programs.
- Retry login systems.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level:**

```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

**Intermediate Level:**

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String again;
do {
    System.out.println("Play again? (yes/no)");
    again = scanner.nextLine();
} while (again.equalsIgnoreCase("yes"));
```

**Advanced Level:**

```java
Connection conn;
do {
    conn = attemptDatabaseConnection();
} while (conn == null);
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Pitfall:** Running critical operations before validation.
- **Best Practice:** Only use if guaranteed at least one safe execution.

---

## 4. For Loop

### Definition and Fundamentals

Best when the number of iterations is **known** beforehand.

**Syntax:**

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code block
}
```

**Where it fits:**

- Iterating over arrays, counters.

**Core Principle:**

- Controlled repetition with clear entry, exit, and progression.

**When to Use:**

- Iterating a fixed-size array.
- Counting.

### Code Examples

**Beginner Level:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```

**Intermediate Level:**

```java
String[] colors = {"Red", "Blue", "Green"};
for (int i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(colors[i]);
}
```

**Advanced Level:**

```java
for (int i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
    System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Pitfall:** Off-by-one errors.
- **Best Practice:** Prefer `for-each` for collections.

## 5. Which Loop to Use

| Situation                    | Loop     |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| Unknown number of iterations | While    |
| Must run at least once       | Do-While |
| Known number of iterations   | For      |

# Real-World Spring Boot Integration

Example: **Polling External API Until Data Available**

**Spring Boot Service:**

```java
@Service
public class DataPollingService {

    private final ExternalApiClient client;

    public DataPollingService(ExternalApiClient client) {
        this.client = client;
    }

    public String fetchDataWithPolling() {
        String data;
        do {
            data = client.fetchData();
            if (data == null) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(5000); // Wait 5 seconds before retrying
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        } while (data == null);
        return data;
    }
}
```

**Spring Configuration Considerations:**

- Use `@Scheduled` for periodic tasks.
- Use `@Async` for non-blocking calls.

# Interview Preparation

## 20 Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is the difference between ********************`while`******************** and ********************`do-while`******************** loops?**

   - `while` checks condition first; `do-while` executes once before checking.

2. **When would you prefer a ********************`for`******************** loop over a ********************`while`******************** loop?**

   - When iteration count is known in advance.

3. **Can a ********************`for`******************** loop be infinite?**

   - Yes, by omitting the condition or setting it always true.

4. **Explain enhanced ********************`for-each`******************** loop.**

   - Used to iterate over collections without explicit index.

5. **What is a nested loop?**

   - A loop inside another loop, often used for multi-dimensional structures.

6. **Can we use multiple variables in a ********************`for`******************** loop?**

   - Yes, separated by commas.

7. **What is loop control statement?**

   - `break` (exit loop) and `continue` (skip to next iteration).

8. **What is infinite loop? How to avoid it?**

   - A loop that never ends; always ensure an exit condition.

9. **Difference between ********************`break`******************** and ********************`return`******************** inside a loop?**

   - `break` exits loop only; `return` exits method entirely.

10. **Performance of ********************`for-each`******************** vs ********************`for`******************** loop?**

    - `for-each` can be less flexible but safer for collections.

11. **How do you prevent infinite loops in Java?**

    - Use conditions that converge; limit retries.

12. **Explain labeled break and continue.**

    - Labels allow exiting outer loops.

13. **Can you write a loop without any body?**

    - Yes. Logic can be placed in update expressions.

14. **How does ********************`for`******************** loop work internally?**

    - Initialization -> Condition -> Body -> Update.

15. **Best loop to read file lines one by one?**

    - `while (scanner.hasNextLine())`

16. **What is a ********************`forEach`******************** method?**

    - Functional programming construct on Streams/Collections.

17. **Do you prefer Streams over traditional loops? Why?**

    - For readability and functional style but depends on use case.

18. **Explain do-while with a real-life scenario.**

    - Retry password at least once.

19. **When would you intentionally create an infinite loop?**

    - Event listener, game loop, server polling.

20. **How does Java optimize loops internally?**

    - Just-in-Time compiler (JIT) may unroll loops.

## Code Challenge

**Problem:** Sum integers 1 to N without using loops directly.

**Solution:**

```java
public int sum(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

**Explain:**

- Used a mathematical formula to optimize performance.
