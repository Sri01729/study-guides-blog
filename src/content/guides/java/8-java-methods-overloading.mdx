## 📘 Definition and Fundamentals

### ✅ Methods in Java
A **method** in Java is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when called (or invoked). Methods are used to improve code modularity, reusability, and organization.

- **Structure:** `returnType methodName(parameters) { // body }`
- **Where it fits:** Methods are fundamental in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), supporting encapsulation and code reuse.
- **Core Concepts:**
  - Declaration and definition
  - Parameters and return types
  - Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, etc.)
  - Static vs instance methods

### ✅ Method Overloading
Method Overloading in Java means having **multiple methods with the same name** but different parameter lists in the same class.

- **Purpose:** Increase flexibility and readability.
- **Java handles it using:**
  - Number of parameters
  - Type of parameters
  - Sequence of parameters

## 💻 Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner Level
```java
public class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
public class Logger {
    void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("INFO: " + message);
    }

    void log(String message, int severity) {
        System.out.println("SEVERITY[" + severity + "]: " + message);
    }
}
```

### Advanced Level
```java
public class Formatter {
    String format(String input) {
        return input.trim();
    }

    String format(String input, boolean upperCase) {
        input = input.trim();
        return upperCase ? input.toUpperCase() : input;
    }

    String format(String input, String prefix, String suffix) {
        return prefix + input.trim() + suffix;
    }
}
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Pitfalls
- Confusing overloading with overriding
- Ambiguous method calls when overloading with varargs
- Using same method name for unrelated functionality

### Performance & Security
- Avoid excessive overloading—it may complicate maintenance.
- Don’t rely on automatic type promotion in overloads; it leads to ambiguity.
- Overloaded methods should ideally perform similar logic to avoid confusion.

### Best Practices
- Group overloaded methods logically
- Use Javadoc to clearly document each version
- Prefer overloading for semantic clarity, not convenience

## 🚀 Real-World Spring Boot Integration

### Scenario: RESTful logging API
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/logs")
public class LogController {

    @GetMapping("/simple")
    public String log(@RequestParam String message) {
        return "Logged: " + message;
    }

    @GetMapping("/detailed")
    public String log(@RequestParam String message, @RequestParam int severity) {
        return "Severity[" + severity + "] Logged: " + message;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- Spring Boot calls appropriate overloaded method based on request parameters.
- Each method can have the same name (`log`), Spring handles binding based on parameter names/types.

## 🎯 Interview Preparation

### Top 20 Questions & Answers

1. **What is a method in Java?**
   > A method is a collection of statements that performs a specific task and returns a result to the caller.

2. **What is method overloading?**
   > Method overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.

3. **Can you overload methods by return type alone?**
   > No, Java does not allow overloading methods by return type alone due to ambiguity.

4. **Why use method overloading?**
   > For code readability, flexibility, and avoiding redundant method names.

5. **How does Java differentiate overloaded methods?**
   > By the number, type, or order of parameters.

6. **Is method overloading compile-time or runtime polymorphism?**
   > Compile-time (static) polymorphism.

7. **What happens if overloaded methods differ only by exception?**
   > The compiler does not consider exceptions in method signatures for overloading.

8. **Can constructors be overloaded?**
   > Yes, constructors can be overloaded in the same way as methods.

9. **Can overloaded methods be in different classes?**
   > No. Overloading occurs in the same class. If in different classes, it could be overriding.

10. **Difference between method overloading and overriding?**
   > Overloading happens within a class with different signatures; overriding occurs across parent-child classes with the same signature.

11. **Can you overload static methods?**
   > Yes. Static methods can be overloaded.

12. **Can varargs cause ambiguity in overloading?**
   > Yes, especially when overloading with similar parameter types.

13. **How does autoboxing affect method overloading?**
   > It can cause the compiler to choose boxed versions which may be unexpected.

14. **Can you overload private methods?**
   > Yes, as long as they're in the same class.

15. **Does method overloading break OOP principles?**
   > No, it supports polymorphism and encapsulation.

16. **Are overloaded methods part of the method signature?**
   > Yes, method name + parameter types define the signature.

17. **What’s the role of method resolution during overloading?**
   > The compiler selects the most specific applicable method during compilation.

18. **Can you overload a method with different access modifiers?**
   > Yes, but access modifier is not part of the method signature.

19. **How does Java resolve overloaded method calls with null?**
   > Ambiguity may occur if multiple applicable overloads exist.

20. **Is overloading supported in other OOP languages?**
   > Yes, languages like C++, C#, and Kotlin support method overloading.

### Follow-Up Questions
- How does overloading interact with inheritance?
- Can overloading affect runtime performance?
- How to unit test overloaded methods?

### Code Challenge

**Problem:** Create a `BankAccount` class with overloaded `deposit()` methods:
- One accepts `int` amount
- Another accepts `double` amount with description
- Another accepts `BigDecimal` with currency

**Solution:**
```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class BankAccount {
    public void deposit(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
    }

    public void deposit(double amount, String description) {
        System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount + " for " + description);
    }

    public void deposit(BigDecimal amount, String currency) {
        System.out.println("Deposited: " + currency + " " + amount);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** Demonstrates real-world use of overloading based on input types.

## 🧠 Demonstrating Deep Understanding
- Discuss when **method overloading** is appropriate and when composition is better.
- Show examples where ambiguity can arise, e.g., `null`, `int` vs `Integer`.
- Explain the compiler’s resolution mechanism.
- Highlight the difference between static and dynamic binding in overloading vs overriding.
