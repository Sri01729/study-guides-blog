## 1. Collection API

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **What**: The `Collection` API in Java provides a unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects.
- **Where**: Part of the `java.util` package.
- **Core principles**:
  - Interfaces like `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`.
  - Implementations like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, etc.
- **When/Why**: To perform operations such as searching, sorting, insertion, deletion on groups of data.

### Code Examples
#### Beginner Level
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
        fruits.add("Apple");
        fruits.add("Banana");
        System.out.println(fruits);
    }
}
```

#### Intermediate Level
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class SetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>();
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(2); // Duplicate, won't be added
        System.out.println(numbers);
    }
}
```

#### Advanced Level
```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class ThreadSafeListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> syncList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
        syncList.add("One");
        syncList.add("Two");
        System.out.println(syncList);
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistakes**: Choosing wrong implementation (`ArrayList` vs `LinkedList`).
- **Performance**: Prefer `ArrayList` for frequent access, `LinkedList` for frequent insertion/removal.
- **Security**: Always use thread-safe collections in concurrent environments.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Prefer interfaces (`List`, `Set`) over concrete classes (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`).
  - Use `Collections.unmodifiableList` to prevent modifications.

### Real-World Spring Boot Integration
- Example: Fetching database records into a `List` or `Set`.
- Spring's `@Repository` layer usually returns collections.
```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findAll();
}
```
- **Enhancements**:
  - Pagination using `Page<T>`.

### Interview Preparation: Collection API
1. What is the Collection Framework in Java?
   - **Answer**: It's a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of data as a single unit.

2. List main interfaces in Collection Framework.
   - **Answer**: `Collection`, `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, `Map` (specialized).

3. Difference between List and Set?
   - **Answer**: List allows duplicates, Set doesn't.

4. What is Iterator?
   - **Answer**: It's an interface to traverse a collection.

5. Fail-fast vs Fail-safe iterators?
   - **Answer**: Fail-fast throws `ConcurrentModificationException`, Fail-safe works on a clone.

## 2. ArrayList

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **What**: A resizable array implementation of the `List` interface.
- **Where**: Part of `java.util` package.
- **Core principles**:
  - Internal array grows dynamically.
  - Random access supported in O(1).
- **When/Why**: Use when frequent access and iteration are needed.

### Code Examples
#### Beginner Level
```java
ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<>();
cars.add("Tesla");
cars.add("BMW");
System.out.println(cars.get(0));
```

#### Intermediate Level
```java
cars.remove("BMW");
cars.set(0, "Audi");
System.out.println(cars);
```

#### Advanced Level
```java
Collections.synchronizedList(cars);
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Pitfall**: Frequent insertions/removals in the middle degrade performance.
- **Best Practice**: Always pre-size the ArrayList if size is known.

### Real-World Spring Boot Integration
- Example: Populate DTOs using ArrayList from service layer.

### Interview Preparation: ArrayList
1. How does ArrayList grow internally?
   - **Answer**: It increases size by 50% when the array is full.

2. How to ensure thread safety in ArrayList?
   - **Answer**: Use `Collections.synchronizedList` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

---

## 3. Set

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **What**: A collection that doesn't allow duplicate elements.
- **Where**: Part of `java.util` package.
- **Core principles**:
  - Hashing based (`HashSet`).
  - Tree structure (`TreeSet`).

### Code Examples
#### Beginner Level
```java
Set<String> cities = new HashSet<>();
cities.add("New York");
cities.add("Los Angeles");
```

#### Intermediate Level
```java
Set<String> sortedCities = new TreeSet<>(cities);
System.out.println(sortedCities);
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake**: Relying on insertion order.
- **Best Practice**: Use `LinkedHashSet` for insertion order.

### Real-World Spring Boot Integration
- Using `Set` in JPA entity relationships.
```java
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private Set<Book> books = new HashSet<>();
```

### Interview Preparation: Set
1. Difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
2. When does HashSet use equals() and hashCode()?

---

## 4. Map

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **What**: A key-value pair collection.
- **Where**: Part of `java.util` package.
- **Core principles**:
  - Hash-based (`HashMap`).
  - Tree-based (`TreeMap`).
  - Linked (`LinkedHashMap`).

### Code Examples
#### Beginner Level
```java
Map<Integer, String> idToName = new HashMap<>();
idToName.put(1, "John");
idToName.put(2, "Doe");
System.out.println(idToName);
```

#### Intermediate Level
```java
idToName.replace(1, "Johnny");
idToName.remove(2);
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake**: Modifying map while iterating.
- **Best Practice**: Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe operations.

### Real-World Spring Boot Integration
- Example: Using `Map` to manage application properties dynamically.

### Interview Preparation: Map
1. Difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
2. What is ConcurrentHashMap?

---

## 5. Comparator vs Comparable

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **Comparable**:
  - Natural ordering inside the object.
- **Comparator**:
  - External sorting logic.

### Code Examples
#### Beginner Level
```java
class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    int marks;

    Student(int marks) {
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    public int compareTo(Student s) {
        return this.marks - s.marks;
    }
}
```

#### Intermediate Level
```java
Comparator<Student> byName = (s1, s2) -> s1.name.compareTo(s2.name);
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Mistake**: Mixing Comparable and Comparator logic.
- **Best Practice**: Keep domain models Comparable, use Comparators in business logic.

### Real-World Spring Boot Integration
- Example: Sorting database results based on multiple fields.
```java
List<Employee> employees = employeeRepository.findAll(Sort.by("salary").descending());
```

### Interview Preparation: Comparator vs Comparable
1. Why do we need Comparator if Comparable exists?
2. How to sort objects without changing their source code?



### Code Challenges

 1. Implement a custom sorting logic on a list of Students by name and then by marks.
 2. Implement a thread-safe map example and explain.
 3. Use Spring Boot to fetch users, remove duplicates, and return sorted list by name.

# Expanded Interview Questions and Answers

### Collection API

6. **What are the differences between Collection and Collections in Java?**
   - **Answer**: `Collection` is an interface for data structures like `List`, `Set`, while `Collections` is a utility class with static methods like `sort()`, `reverse()`, `shuffle()`.

7. **Can we add null elements to a collection?**
   - **Answer**: Yes, most collections like `ArrayList`, `HashSet` allow one null element. `TreeSet` may throw `NullPointerException` if comparator is used.

8. **Explain the hierarchy of Collection Framework.**
   - **Answer**: `Collection` -> `List`, `Set`, `Queue`. `Map` is a separate hierarchy.

9. **What are concurrent collections in Java?**
   - **Answer**: Thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue`.

10. **What is the default initial capacity of an ArrayList?**
    - **Answer**: 10.

### ArrayList

11. **What happens if we add elements beyond the initial capacity in ArrayList?**
    - **Answer**: A new array is created internally with a larger size (1.5x).

12. **Why is ArrayList not thread-safe?**
    - **Answer**: It does not synchronize its methods.

13. **When would you prefer LinkedList over ArrayList?**
    - **Answer**: Frequent insertions/deletions in the middle of the list.

14. **How to create an immutable ArrayList?**
    - **Answer**: Use `List.of()` in Java 9+ or `Collections.unmodifiableList()`.

### Set

15. **What is the time complexity of add, remove, contains in HashSet?**
    - **Answer**: Average case O(1), worst case O(n).

16. **How does a HashSet maintain uniqueness?**
    - **Answer**: Using `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.

17. **Difference between LinkedHashSet and TreeSet?**
    - **Answer**: `LinkedHashSet` maintains insertion order, `TreeSet` maintains sorted order.

18. **Can TreeSet store heterogeneous objects?**
    - **Answer**: No, it will throw `ClassCastException`.

### Map

19. **How does HashMap work internally?**
    - **Answer**: Hashing the key, calculating index, handling collisions using chaining.

20. **Can we have null keys and values in HashMap?**
    - **Answer**: One null key allowed, multiple null values allowed.

21. **Difference between HashMap and LinkedHashMap?**
    - **Answer**: `LinkedHashMap` maintains insertion order.

22. **Why is Hashtable considered obsolete?**
    - **Answer**: Because `ConcurrentHashMap` provides better concurrency.

### Comparator vs Comparable

23. **When should you use Comparable?**
    - **Answer**: When natural order is needed inside the entity class.

24. **When should you use Comparator?**
    - **Answer**: When multiple sort sequences or external sorting is needed.

25. **How to sort a list of objects based on multiple fields?**
    - **Answer**: Chain comparators using `Comparator.thenComparing()`.

26. **Can a class implement multiple Comparators?**
    - **Answer**: Yes, by writing multiple Comparator implementations.

### Bonus Deep Questions

27. **What is hashCode and equals contract?**
    - **Answer**: If two objects are equal (equals()), they must have the same hashCode.

28. **What are WeakHashMap and IdentityHashMap?**
    - **Answer**: `WeakHashMap` keys can be garbage collected. `IdentityHashMap` compares keys by reference (==).

29. **What is EnumSet?**
    - **Answer**: A high-performance Set for enum types.

30. **Explain CopyOnWriteArrayList.**
    - **Answer**: A thread-safe variant of ArrayList where all mutative operations (add, set, etc.) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array.
