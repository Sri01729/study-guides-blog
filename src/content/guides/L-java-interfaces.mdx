# Interface in Java

## Definition and Fundamentals

### What is an Interface?

An **interface** in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only abstract methods (until Java 7) and constants. From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can also have default and static methods.

- **Definition**: Blueprint of a class that declares methods but does not implement them.
- **Where it fits**: Key concept in Java for abstraction, polymorphism, and multiple inheritance.
- **Core principles**:
  - **Abstraction**: Defines "what" needs to be done without specifying "how".
  - **Multiple Inheritance**: Java classes cannot extend multiple classes but can implement multiple interfaces.
- **When and why to use**:
  - To achieve loose coupling.
  - To allow multiple unrelated classes to implement common behavior.
  - To define contracts between different components.

### Types of Interfaces

1. **Normal Interfaces**
   - Contain only abstract methods (pre-Java 8).

2. **Functional Interfaces**
   - Contain exactly one abstract method.
   - Examples: `Runnable`, `Callable`.

3. **Marker Interfaces**
   - No methods or fields.
   - Used to signal JVM (e.g., `Serializable`, `Cloneable`).

4. **Tagged Interfaces**
   - Similar to marker interfaces but used for tagging classes.

5. **Nested Interfaces**
   - Defined within another class or interface.
   - Helps logically group interfaces.

6. **Private Interfaces (From Java 9)**
   - Interfaces can have private methods to encapsulate helper methods inside interfaces.

7. **Static Methods in Interfaces (Java 8)**
   - Interfaces can define static methods.

8. **Default Methods (Java 8)**
   - Interfaces can have default implementations.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner Level: Basic Syntax

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Level: Multiple Interfaces

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck flies.");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck swims.");
    }
}

public class TestInterfaces {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Duck duck = new Duck();
        duck.fly();
        duck.swim();
    }
}
```

### Advanced Level: Default Methods and Functional Interfaces

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();

    default void fuel() {
        System.out.println("Fueling vehicle...");
    }

    static void service() {
        System.out.println("Servicing vehicle...");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}

public class AdvancedInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.start();
        car.fuel();
        Vehicle.service();
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Frequent Mistakes

- Forgetting to implement all abstract methods.
- Confusing interfaces with abstract classes.
- Overusing interfaces for trivial logic.

### Performance Considerations

- Interfaces introduce a minor runtime overhead due to dynamic dispatch (virtual method table lookup).
- Keep interfaces small (Single Responsibility Principle).

### Security Considerations

- Ensure sensitive operations are not exposed via public interfaces unnecessarily.

### Code Smells and Anti-Patterns

- **God Interface**: Too many methods in one interface.
- **Marker Interface Abuse**: Unnecessary use without clear semantics.

### Best Practices

- Prefer multiple small interfaces over one big one (Interface Segregation Principle).
- Use meaningful, action-based names (`Runnable`, `Readable`).
- Favor interfaces over concrete classes in method parameters and return types.

## Real-World Spring Boot Integration

### Practical Example

Creating a **PaymentService** using interfaces for loose coupling between services.

#### Code Sample

```java
// PaymentService.java
public interface PaymentService {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

// CreditCardPaymentService.java
@Service
public class CreditCardPaymentService implements PaymentService {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

// PaymentController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/payments")
public class PaymentController {

    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public PaymentController(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> makePayment(@RequestParam double amount) {
        paymentService.processPayment(amount);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Payment successful");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- Spring Boot leverages interfaces for **dependency injection**.
- Allows flexibility: easily switch to `PaypalPaymentService` or `StripePaymentService` without changing the controller.

### Configuration Considerations

- Use `@Qualifier` if multiple beans implement the same interface.
- Profile-based beans with `@Profile` annotation for environment-specific implementations.

## Interview Preparation

### 20+ Common Interview Questions and Detailed Answers

1. **What is an interface in Java?**

> A reference type that defines method signatures without implementing them.

2. **Can an interface have method implementations?**

> Yes, from Java 8 via `default` and `static` methods.

3. **Why do we use interfaces?**

> To achieve abstraction, loose coupling, and multiple inheritance.

4. **What is the difference between abstract class and interface?**

> Abstract classes can have state (fields), constructors, and methods with or without body; interfaces can't have constructors and (pre-Java 8) couldn't have method implementations.

5. **Can interfaces extend other interfaces?**

> Yes, an interface can extend multiple interfaces.

6. **Can a class implement multiple interfaces?**

> Yes, it supports multiple inheritance of type.

7. **What is a marker interface?**

> Interface with no methods or fields (e.g., `Serializable`).

8. **What happens if you do not implement all methods of an interface?**

> The class must be declared `abstract`.

9. **How are interface methods by default?**

> `public` and `abstract`.

10. **What is functional interface?**

> An interface with exactly one abstract method (e.g., `Runnable`, `Callable`).

11. **What is @FunctionalInterface annotation?**

> It is used to indicate that an interface is a functional interface.

12. **What is the role of interfaces in Dependency Injection?**

> Helps in injecting different implementations at runtime.

13. **Can an interface extend a class?**

> No, it can only extend another interface.

14. **What access modifiers are allowed for interface methods?**

> Only `public`.

15. **How are variables declared in interfaces?**

> `public static final` implicitly.

16. **Can interfaces have constructors?**

> No.

17. **What is the diamond problem and how Java interfaces avoid it?**

> Diamond problem arises in multiple inheritance. Interfaces solve it by forcing overriding.

18. **Can interface be instantiated?**

> No, but you can reference an implementation.

19. **What are default methods good for?**

> Adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

20. **What is the impact of interfaces on system design?**

> Promotes extensibility, testability, and maintainability.

### Follow-up Questions Interviewers Might Ask

- How do interfaces help in testing?
- How to inject specific implementations when multiple beans exist?
- Can default methods lead to issues?

### Code Challenges

**Challenge 1**: Create a Shape interface with area() and perimeter() methods.

```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
    double perimeter();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double perimeter() {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
}

public class TestShape {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        System.out.println("Area: " + circle.area());
        System.out.println("Perimeter: " + circle.perimeter());
    }
}
```

### How to Demonstrate Deep Understanding

- Talk about Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
- Show real-world designs using interfaces.
- Discuss how interfaces help with unit testing (mocking dependencies).
- Explain the evolution from Java 7 to Java 8+ with default methods.
