## üßµ What is String in Java

### Definition and Fundamentals
- A `String` in Java is an object that represents a sequence of characters.
- Strings are **immutable**, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.
- Part of `java.lang` package and treated as a special class with many overloaded operators and syntactic sugar (e.g., `+` for concatenation).

### Fit in Java Ecosystem
- Used *everywhere*: input/output, logging, configuration, identifiers, UI display, REST APIs.
- Underpins much of the Java standard library and enterprise development.

### Core Principles
- Stored in **String Pool** (a special memory region inside the heap) for memory efficiency.
- Uses **UTF-16 encoding** internally.
- Methods like `.length()`, `.substring()`, `.equals()` are commonly used.

### When and Why
- Use `String` when you need to store text values that don‚Äôt change often.
- Ideal for constants, configuration keys, and readable identifiers.

## üîÅ Mutable vs Immutable Strings

### Immutability in `String`
- Any modification (like concatenation) creates a **new String**.
- Safe for multithreading without synchronization.

### Mutable Alternatives
- **`StringBuilder`**: non-thread-safe, fast.
- **`StringBuffer`**: thread-safe, slower.

### Example Comparison
```java
String s = "Hello";
s = s + " World"; // New string created

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World"); // Same object modified
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è StringBuffer and StringBuilder

### Definition
- Both are classes used to create **mutable strings**.
- Located in `java.lang` package.

### Differences
| Feature        | StringBuffer        | StringBuilder       |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Thread-safe    | Yes (synchronized)  | No                   |
| Performance    | Slower              | Faster               |
| Use-case       | Multi-threaded apps | Single-threaded apps |

### Code Example
```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Redin");
sb.append("AI");
System.out.println(sb.toString()); // RedinAI
```

## üß™ Code Examples by Level

### ‚úÖ Beginner Level
```java
String name = "Sai";
System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
```

### üîÑ Intermediate Level
```java
String fullName = "Sai Srinivas Alahari";
if (fullName.contains("Sai")) {
    System.out.println("Match found");
}
```

### üßµ Advanced Level (Thread Safety with StringBuffer)
```java
public class Logger {
    private StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();

    public synchronized void log(String message) {
        buffer.append(message).append("\n");
    }
}
```

## üö© Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Pitfalls
- Using `+` for repeated concatenation in loops.
- Using `==` for comparison instead of `.equals()`.
- Overusing `StringBuffer` in single-threaded apps.

### Best Practices
- Use `StringBuilder` for intensive concatenation.
- Prefer `.equals()` and `.equalsIgnoreCase()` for value comparison.
- Avoid unnecessary `new String()` calls.
- Use `String.format()` or `MessageFormat` for formatting.

## üöÄ Real-World Spring Boot Integration

### Use Case
Creating a welcome message using dynamic `StringBuilder` logic in a REST controller.

### Code
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/greet")
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/{name}")
    public String greet(@PathVariable String name) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Welcome, ");
        sb.append(name).append("! Happy to see you using Spring Boot.");
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- Avoids repeated string creation.
- Easy extension with logging/debugging.

### Config Considerations
- Use `@RestController`, `@PathVariable` annotations.
- Enable `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy=ant_path_matcher` if you run into path issues.

## üíº Interview Preparation

### Top 20 Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is a String in Java?**
A `String` is an immutable sequence of characters backed by a `char[]`. It is widely used in Java for handling text.

2. **Why are Strings immutable in Java?**
To ensure security, thread-safety, and efficient memory usage through String Pooling.

3. **Difference between `==` and `.equals()` for Strings?**
`==` compares references; `.equals()` compares content.

4. **What is String Pool?**
A memory optimization technique where identical string literals share the same memory location.

5. **What happens when you concatenate Strings with `+` in a loop?**
New strings are created repeatedly, leading to performance issues.

6. **How do you improve string concatenation performance?**
Use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` instead of `+`.

7. **What is the difference between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`?**
`StringBuilder` is faster and non-synchronized; `StringBuffer` is thread-safe.

8. **How to make a `StringBuilder` thread-safe?**
Either use synchronization manually or switch to `StringBuffer`.

9. **Can you change the content of a String object?**
No, because Strings are immutable.

10. **How does `.substring()` work internally?**
It creates a new string using the specified range of the original.

11. **How to compare two strings ignoring case?**
Use `.equalsIgnoreCase()`.

12. **What does `intern()` method do?**
It moves the string to the pool if not already present and returns the pooled reference.

13. **Explain the usage of `String.format()`.**
Used for formatted strings similar to printf: `String.format("Name: %s", name)`.

14. **What‚Äôs the initial capacity of StringBuilder?**
16 characters by default.

15. **How can you reverse a string in Java?**
Use `new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString()`.

16. **What is the time complexity of `charAt()`?**
O(1) ‚Äì Constant time.

17. **Why should we avoid `new String("abc")`?**
It creates a new object in heap even if one exists in pool.

18. **What‚Äôs the difference between `trim()` and `strip()` in Java 11+?**
`strip()` is Unicode-aware; `trim()` only removes ASCII whitespace.

19. **How do you check if a string is a palindrome?**
Compare the original with its reversed version.

20. **What is the purpose of `StringJoiner` introduced in Java 8?**
To join multiple strings with a delimiter efficiently.

### Follow-up Interview Questions
- How would you implement your own immutable String class?
- How can you avoid memory leaks with large substrings?
- Explain why `StringBuilder` is not suitable for shared resources.

### Code Challenge: Reverse Words in a String
**Problem:** Reverse the words in a sentence: "Java is awesome" ‚Üí "awesome is Java"

**Solution:**
```java
public String reverseWords(String sentence) {
    String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
    Collections.reverse(Arrays.asList(words));
    return String.join(" ", words);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Split the sentence.
- Reverse the list.
- Join it back with spaces.

**Deep Understanding Tip:**
Talk about time-space complexity and why mutability helps in such operations (i.e., using `StringBuilder` during manipulations).
