## 1. Need of Inheritance

### Definition and Fundamentals
Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing one class (child/subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (parent/superclass).

**Where it fits:**
- Core part of Java's OOP principles.
- Foundational for frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate, etc.

**Core Principles:**
- Hierarchical relationship.
- Promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Supports polymorphism and code extensibility.

**When and Why to Use:**
- When multiple classes share common properties and behaviors.
- To extend or modify the behavior of existing classes.

### Code Examples
**Beginner Level:**
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // inherited method
        dog.bark();
    }
}
```

**Intermediate Level:**
```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed = 40;

    void move() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle moves at speed: " + speed);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int wheels = 4;

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Car has " + wheels + " wheels.");
    }
}
```

**Advanced Level:**
```java
abstract class Employee {
    String name;
    int id;

    abstract double calculateSalary();
}

class Developer extends Employee {
    @Override
    double calculateSalary() {
        return 70000.00;
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    @Override
    double calculateSalary() {
        return 90000.00;
    }
}
```

## 2. What is Inheritance

### Definition and Fundamentals
Inheritance is the mechanism in Java where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class.

**Where it fits:**
- Fundamental pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Core Principles:**
- Reduces redundancy.
- Improves code maintainability.
- Enhances polymorphism.

**When and Why to Use:**
- Reusing existing code.
- Extending class functionalities.

### Code Examples
**Beginner Level:**
```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
}

public class TestInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```

**Intermediate and Advanced examples** covered under "Need of Inheritance" above.

## 3. Single and Multilevel Inheritance

### Definition and Fundamentals
- **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from one parent class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a class which in turn inherits from another class.

**Where it fits:**
- Simplifies code hierarchy.
- Forms logical relationships.

**Core Principles:**
- Structured extension of behavior.

**When and Why to Use:**
- For complex hierarchies where behaviors build progressively.

### Code Examples
**Single Inheritance Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

**Multilevel Inheritance Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Mammal walks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

## 4. Multiple Inheritance

### Definition and Fundamentals
- Java does **NOT** support multiple inheritance using classes to avoid ambiguity issues (Diamond Problem).
- Achieved through **Interfaces**.

**Where it fits:**
- Important for designing flexible systems.

**Core Principles:**
- Interface-based multiple inheritance.

**When and Why to Use:**
- When a class needs functionalities from multiple sources.

### Code Example
```java
interface A {
    void displayA();
}

interface B {
    void displayB();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void displayA() {
        System.out.println("Display from A");
    }
    public void displayB() {
        System.out.println("Display from B");
    }
}
```

## 5. Method Overriding

### Definition and Fundamentals
Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method declared in its parent class.

**Where it fits:**
- Key to achieving **runtime polymorphism**.

**Core Principles:**
- Method signatures must match.
- Access level cannot be more restrictive.

**When and Why to Use:**
- To change inherited behavior.
- To provide specialized functionality.

### Code Example
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

# Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Pitfalls
- Misunderstanding constructor invocation (Parent constructor must be called).
- Accidentally hiding fields instead of overriding.
- Misuse of `super` keyword.

### Best Practices
- Always use `@Override` annotation.
- Favor composition over inheritance when appropriate.
- Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow.
- Design with interfaces for flexibility.

# Real-World Spring Boot Integration

### Example: Entity Inheritance
```java
import jakarta.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public abstract class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
}

@Entity
public class AdminUser extends User {
    private String adminSection;
}
```

**How Spring Boot enhances Inheritance:**
- Automatically maps inheritance using JPA.
- Reduces boilerplate.

**Configuration Considerations:**
- Use appropriate `@Inheritance(strategy = ...)` type based on needs (JOINED, SINGLE_TABLE, TABLE_PER_CLASS).

# Interview Preparation

### 20+ Common Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is inheritance in Java?**
> Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods of another class, promoting code reuse.

2. **Why does Java not support multiple inheritance using classes?**
> To avoid ambiguity issues like the Diamond Problem; instead, Java uses interfaces.

3. **What is the difference between overriding and overloading?**
> Overriding changes inherited method behavior; overloading means methods with same name but different parameters.

4. **What is the use of `super` keyword?**
> It refers to the immediate parent class and can call parent constructors or methods.

5. **Explain method overriding rules.**
> Same signature, cannot reduce visibility, can widen visibility, must maintain return type (covariant allowed).

6. **What is runtime polymorphism?**
> Behavior decided at runtime using method overriding.

7. **What are the types of inheritance in Java?**
> Single, multilevel, hierarchical (not multiple through classes).

8. **What is multilevel inheritance?**
> A class is derived from another derived class.

9. **How is multiple inheritance achieved in Java?**
> Using interfaces.

10. **Can a constructor be inherited?**
> No. Constructors are not inherited but parent constructors can be invoked.

11. **What happens if you don't call `super()` explicitly?**
> Compiler inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the parent class.

12. **What is the diamond problem?**
> Ambiguity when two parent classes have same method signature.

13. **What is the use of abstract classes in inheritance?**
> Provides a base class with partial implementation.

14. **What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces?**
> Abstract classes can have constructors and state; interfaces cannot (till Java 7).

15. **Can a final method be overridden?**
> No, final methods cannot be overridden.

16. **Can a private method be overridden?**
> No. Private methods are not inherited.

17. **What is hierarchical inheritance?**
> Multiple classes inherit from a single class.

18. **What is the difference between IS-A and HAS-A relationship?**
> IS-A: Inheritance (Dog IS-A Animal), HAS-A: Composition (Car HAS-A Engine).

19. **When should you prefer composition over inheritance?**
> When flexibility and loose coupling are needed.

20. **What are marker interfaces?**
> Interfaces with no methods (e.g., Serializable).

### Code Challenges

**Challenge 1:** Create a base `Shape` class with a method `area()` and extend it with `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` classes.

**Solution:**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    Circle(double r) {
        radius = r;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double length, width;

    Rectangle(double l, double w) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
    double base, height;

    Triangle(double b, double h) {
        base = b;
        height = h;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
}
```

### How to demonstrate deep understanding
- Emphasize SOLID principles.
- Explain when inheritance vs composition is preferred.
- Talk about Java-specific features like `@Inheritance` annotation in Spring Boot.
- Discuss handling pitfalls (e.g., constructor chaining, diamond problem).
