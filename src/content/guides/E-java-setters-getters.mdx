# Getters and Setters

## Definition and Fundamentals
**Getters and setters** are methods used to access (get) and update (set) the private fields of a class. This practice is central to **encapsulation** in Java.

- **Where it fits:** Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) pillar - Encapsulation.
- **Core Principle:** Hide data fields and expose controlled access.

**Why use them?**
- Protect internal state.
- Add validation when setting values.
- Maintain flexibility to modify internal implementation without breaking API.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

### Intermediate
Adding validation:
```java
public void setName(String name) {
    if(name == null || name.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be null or empty");
    }
    this.name = name;
}
```

### Advanced
Immutable class pattern:
```java
public final class Person {
    private final String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        if(name == null || name.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be null or empty");
        }
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Mistakes:**
  - Exposing setters for immutable fields.
  - Forgetting validation inside setters.
- **Optimization:**
  - Use records (`record` keyword) if all you need is a data carrier class.
- **Security:**
  - Never expose sensitive fields directly; always control access.
- **Code smells:**
  - Java Beans with too many getters and setters without behavior (Anemic Domain Model).

**Modern practice:** Use Lombok (`@Getter`, `@Setter`) to reduce boilerplate.

# `this` Keyword

## Definition and Fundamentals
The `this` keyword is a reference to the current object inside a method or constructor.

- **Where it fits:** Java object referencing.
- **Core Principle:** Differentiate between class fields and method parameters.

**When to use?**
- Name conflict resolution.
- Method chaining.
- Passing the current object.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner
```java
public class Car {
    private String model;

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
}
```

### Intermediate - Method chaining
```java
public class Car {
    private String model;

    public Car setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
        return this;
    }
}
```

### Advanced - Passing current object
```java
public class Car {
    private String model;

    public void printDetails(Car car) {
        System.out.println(car.model);
    }

    public void show() {
        printDetails(this);
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Mistakes:**
  - Overusing `this` when not needed, making code verbose.
- **Best practice:**
  - Use it only for clarity when thereâ€™s ambiguity.

# Constructors

## Definition and Fundamentals
**Constructors** are special methods invoked when creating an object. They initialize object state.

- **Where it fits:** Java class life cycle.
- **Core Principle:** Object instantiation and initialization.

**Default Constructor:** No parameters.
**Parameterized Constructor:** Accepts arguments to initialize fields.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner - Default Constructor
```java
public class Student {
    public Student() {
        System.out.println("Student created");
    }
}
```

### Intermediate - Parameterized Constructor
```java
public class Student {
    private String name;

    public Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

### Advanced - Constructor Overloading
```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student() {
        this("Unknown", 0);
    }

    public Student(String name) {
        this(name, 0);
    }

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Mistakes:**
  - Not initializing mandatory fields.
- **Performance:**
  - Heavy work inside constructors can delay object creation.
- **Best practice:**
  - Keep constructors lightweight.

# Real-World Spring Boot Integration

## Example

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class AppConfig {
    private final String appName;

    public AppConfig(@Value("${app.name}") String appName) {
        this.appName = appName;
    }

    public String getAppName() {
        return appName;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Constructor Injection is preferred in Spring Boot.
- `@Value` injects properties.
- `@Component` makes the class a Spring Bean.

**Configuration considerations:**
- Prefer constructor injection over field injection.
- Immutable classes work beautifully with Spring Boot.

# Interview Preparation

## 20 Common Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What are getters and setters?
**Answer:** Methods to access and modify private fields, supporting encapsulation.

### 2. Why do we use the `this` keyword in Java?
**Answer:** To refer to the current object and resolve naming conflicts between fields and parameters.

### 3. Can a constructor be private?
**Answer:** Yes. It's used in Singleton patterns and factory methods.

### 4. What is a default constructor?
**Answer:** A constructor with no parameters, created automatically if no other constructors are defined.

### 5. What is a parameterized constructor?
**Answer:** A constructor that takes arguments to initialize an object.

### 6. Can you overload constructors?
**Answer:** Yes. Multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

### 7. What happens if you define only a parameterized constructor?
**Answer:** Java no longer provides a default constructor.

### 8. When should you make fields private and use getters/setters?
**Answer:** Always, to maintain control over field access and ensure encapsulation.

### 9. What's the risk of exposing setters freely?
**Answer:** State inconsistency and violation of business rules.

### 10. Why should constructors be lightweight?
**Answer:** Heavy constructors delay object creation and slow system startup.

### 11. How do Lombok annotations help?
**Answer:** `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, etc., auto-generate boilerplate code.

### 12. Can you call another constructor inside a constructor?
**Answer:** Yes, using `this(...)`.

### 13. How does Spring Boot use constructors?
**Answer:** Through constructor-based dependency injection.

### 14. Difference between field and constructor injection?
**Answer:** Constructor injection ensures immutability and easier testing.

### 15. When would you use a private constructor?
**Answer:** In Singleton, Static Factory Methods, or Utility classes.

### 16. What is method chaining?
**Answer:** Using `this` to return the current object from a setter to chain calls.

### 17. What if you don't write a constructor?
**Answer:** Java supplies a no-argument default constructor.

### 18. Is it mandatory to use `this` keyword?
**Answer:** No, unless resolving name conflicts.

### 19. How to create an immutable object?
**Answer:** Make fields final, class final, provide only getters.

### 20. Why use constructors over setters for initialization?
**Answer:** Guarantees object integrity by enforcing mandatory field values at creation.

## Follow-up Questions
- Explain constructor overloading with an example.
- How does the `this()` call work internally?
- How would you implement a Singleton pattern with a private constructor?
- How do frameworks like Hibernate use getters and setters?

## Code Challenges

### Challenge 1: Create a class with overloaded constructors
```java
class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int id;

    public Employee() {
        this("Unknown", -1);
    }

    public Employee(String name) {
        this(name, -1);
    }

    public Employee(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

**Solution Explanation:**
- Default values are assigned if parameters are missing.
- Reuse code with constructor chaining.

### Challenge 2: Write a Spring Bean with constructor injection
```java
@Component
public class ServiceLayer {
    private final RepositoryLayer repositoryLayer;

    public ServiceLayer(RepositoryLayer repositoryLayer) {
        this.repositoryLayer = repositoryLayer;
    }
}
```

**Solution Explanation:**
- Follows Spring Boot best practice: constructor-based injection.
- Ensures immutability and easy unit testing.
