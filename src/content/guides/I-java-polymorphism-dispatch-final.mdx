# Polymorphism

## Definition and Fundamentals
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables a single interface to control access to a wide range of implementations.

**Where it fits**: Core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principle.

**Core principles**: Inheritance, method overriding, interfaces.

**Why use**: Promotes code reusability, flexibility, and scalability.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.sound();
    }
}
```

### Intermediate
```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
    }
}

public class DrawingApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Circle();
        shape.draw();

        shape = new Rectangle();
        shape.draw();
    }
}
```

### Advanced
```java
abstract class Payment {
    abstract void pay(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

class PayPalPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal");
    }
}

public class PaymentGateway {
    public static void processPayment(Payment payment, double amount) {
        payment.pay(amount);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        processPayment(new CreditCardPayment(), 200.00);
        processPayment(new PayPalPayment(), 150.00);
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Not understanding method overriding vs method overloading.
  - Typecasting mistakes leading to `ClassCastException`.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Program to an interface, not an implementation.
  - Keep polymorphic behavior predictable and consistent.

## Real-World Spring Boot Integration
**Problem**: Different types of notifications (Email, SMS).

```java
public interface NotificationService {
    void sendNotification(String message);
}

@Service("emailService")
class EmailNotificationService implements NotificationService {
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Email: " + message);
    }
}

@Service("smsService")
class SmsNotificationService implements NotificationService {
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS: " + message);
    }
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/notify")
public class NotificationController {

    private final Map<String, NotificationService> services;

    @Autowired
    public NotificationController(List<NotificationService> servicesList) {
        this.services = servicesList.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.toMap(s -> s.getClass().getSimpleName(), s -> s));
    }

    @PostMapping("/{type}")
    public void notify(@PathVariable String type, @RequestBody String message) {
        NotificationService service = services.get(type + "Service");
        if (service != null) {
            service.sendNotification(message);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown Notification Type");
        }
    }
}
```

# Dynamic Method Dispatch

## Definition and Fundamentals
Dynamic Method Dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

**Where it fits**: Enables runtime polymorphism.

**Core principles**: Late binding, method overriding.

**Why use**: Achieve flexible and scalable code behavior based on the object's runtime type.

## Code Example
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent's show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child's show()");
    }
}

public class DispatchDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.show();
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls
- Assuming the reference type determines the method called (it's the object type!).
- Forgetting the importance of runtime binding.

# Final Keyword

## Definition and Fundamentals
The `final` keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.

- **Final variable**: Constant value.
- **Final method**: Cannot be overridden.
- **Final class**: Cannot be subclassed.

**Where it fits**: Security, performance optimization, design contracts.

**Why use**: Ensure immutability, prevent inheritance for security.

## Code Example
```java
final class Constants {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;
}

class Vehicle {
    final void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Cannot override start()
}
```

## Common Pitfalls
- Misusing `final` when flexibility is needed.
- Not using `final` on constants leading to accidental changes.

## Best Practices
- Use `final` for constants.
- Use `final` parameters in methods when arguments should not change.

## Code Challenge

### Problem
Create an application that has a `Vehicle` base class and subclasses like `Bike` and `Car` implementing a `start()` method.

### Solution
```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike is starting");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting");
    }
}

public class TestPolymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v;
        v = new Bike();
        v.start();

        v = new Car();
        v.start();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: Demonstrates dynamic method dispatch.
