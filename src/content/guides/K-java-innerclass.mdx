# Inner Classes in Java

## Definition and Fundamentals

**Inner Class**: An inner class is a class defined inside another class. It can access private members of the outer class and is primarily used to logically group classes that are only used in one place.

- **Where it fits**: Java ecosystem uses Inner Classes to create more readable and maintainable code, especially in GUI applications, event handling, or helper classes.
- **Core Principles**:
  - Encapsulation
  - Logical grouping
  - Tight coupling with the outer class
- **When and Why**:
  - When a class is useful only to its enclosing class.
  - To increase encapsulation.
  - To logically group classes and reduce namespace pollution.

## Code Examples with Progressive Complexity

### Beginner Level
```java
public class OuterClass {
    private String message = "Hello from OuterClass!";

    class InnerClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
        OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
        inner.display();
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
public class Button {
    private String label;

    public Button(String label) {
        this.label = label;
    }

    public void click() {
        System.out.println(label + " clicked!");
    }

    class ButtonHandler {
        public void handleClick() {
            click();
        }
    }
}
```

### Advanced Level
```java
public class ThreadSafeCounter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    class CounterTask implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                increment();
            }
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

# Anonymous Inner Classes

## Definition and Fundamentals

**Anonymous Inner Class**: A class without a name that is declared and instantiated in a single statement.

- **Where it fits**: Used when creating a short implementation of an interface or extending a class for one-time use.
- **Core Principles**:
  - One-time use
  - Local scope
  - Reduces boilerplate code
- **When and Why**:
  - When you need to override methods without creating a separate named class.
  - For event handling, Runnable, Callbacks, etc.

## Code Examples

### Beginner Level
```java
Runnable task = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running task...");
    }
};

new Thread(task).start();
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
Button button = new Button("Submit");
button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Button clicked!");
    }
});
```

### Advanced Level
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
list.forEach(new Consumer<String>() {
    @Override
    public void accept(String item) {
        System.out.println("Item: " + item);
    }
});
```

# Abstract and Anonymous Inner Classes

## Definition and Fundamentals

An **Anonymous Inner Class** can extend an abstract class and provide implementations for its abstract methods on the spot.

## Code Example
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Animal() {
            @Override
            void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Bark!");
            }
        };
        dog.makeSound();
    }
}
```

# Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Pitfalls
- Overusing inner classes causing confusion.
- Memory leaks if inner classes hold a strong reference to outer classes.
- Making inner classes too complex.

### Best Practices
- Keep inner classes small and focused.
- Prefer static nested classes if inner class does not need access to outer class instance.
- Use lambda expressions when possible (Java 8+).

# Real-World Spring Boot Integration

## Example
Suppose you have a service that processes user notifications.

```java
@Service
public class NotificationService {

    public interface Notifier {
        void send(String message);
    }

    public void notifyUser(String user, String message) {
        Notifier notifier = new Notifier() {
            @Override
            public void send(String message) {
                System.out.println("Sending to " + user + ": " + message);
            }
        };
        notifier.send(message);
    }
}
```

**Spring Boot Enhancements**:
- Spring encourages use of **functional interfaces** with lambdas for such short implementations.
- You can autowire services and still use inner/anonymous classes inside them.

# Interview Preparation

## Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is an Inner Class in Java?**
   > A class declared within another class to logically group classes that belong together.

2. **What types of Inner Classes exist?**
   > Regular Inner Class, Static Nested Class, Local Inner Class, Anonymous Inner Class.

3. **Difference between Static Nested Class and Inner Class?**
   > Static nested class does not have access to instance variables of outer class, inner class does.

4. **When would you use an Inner Class?**
   > When the class is tightly coupled with its outer class.

5. **How do Anonymous Inner Classes work?**
   > They extend a class or implement an interface without giving a name.

6. **Can an Inner Class be static?**
   > Only nested classes can be static, regular inner classes cannot.

7. **Can an Inner Class access private fields of Outer Class?**
   > Yes, it can access all members.

8. **Example of Abstract Anonymous Class?**
   > See `Animal` example where method `makeSound` is implemented.

9. **What is Local Inner Class?**
   > Class defined inside a method.

10. **Why use Anonymous Inner Class for event handling?**
    > Reduces boilerplate, suitable for small one-time-use handlers.

11. **How can an Inner Class access Outer Class instance?**
    > Using `OuterClassName.this` reference.

12. **Is there a memory leak risk with Inner Classes?**
    > Yes, if it holds references after outer class is garbage collected.

13. **Difference between Lambda Expression and Anonymous Inner Class?**
    > Lambda is more concise, anonymous classes can have state and multiple methods.

14. **Can you serialize an Inner Class?**
    > Only if it is static or declared serializable.

15. **What restrictions apply to Local Inner Classes?**
    > Can only access final or effectively final variables from the enclosing scope.

16. **How does Java Compiler treat Inner Classes?**
    > It compiles them into separate `.class` files.

17. **Can you declare Static methods inside Inner Class?**
    > Only in Static Nested Classes.

18. **Is dependency injection possible with Inner Classes?**
    > Yes, but it's discouraged; better to inject into outer class.

19. **Are Anonymous Classes a good practice today?**
    > Prefer lambdas for single-method implementations.

20. **How do you optimize Inner Classes in enterprise applications?**
    > Use them only when logical grouping is absolutely needed.

## Follow-up Interview Questions
- Can you show an example of a real-world application where you used inner classes?
- How would you refactor a complex anonymous class?
- Would you prefer Lambda expressions over Anonymous classes in Java 8+?

## Code Challenges

**Challenge**:
Create an inner class that simulates a Bank Account with deposit and withdrawal features and prints transaction history.

### Solution
```java
public class Bank {
    private String accountHolder;
    private double balance;

    public Bank(String name, double initialDeposit) {
        this.accountHolder = name;
        this.balance = initialDeposit;
    }

    class Transaction {
        public void deposit(double amount) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
        }

        public void withdraw(double amount) {
            if (balance >= amount) {
                balance -= amount;
                System.out.println("Withdrawn: " + amount);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Insufficient balance!");
            }
        }

        public void displayBalance() {
            System.out.println("Balance: " + balance);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bank bank = new Bank("Sai", 1000);
        Bank.Transaction transaction = bank.new Transaction();
        transaction.deposit(500);
        transaction.withdraw(200);
        transaction.displayBalance();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: Demonstrates encapsulation, coupling, and local access through an inner class!
