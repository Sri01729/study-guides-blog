description: In-depth guide to Class and Object theory and practice, and how JDK, JRE, and JVM form the foundation of Java runtime.

### Class:
- A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- It defines the structure (fields) and behavior (methods) that the objects created from it will have.

```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving...");
    }
}
```

### Object:
- An **object** is an instance of a class.
- It occupies memory and has a state (data) and behavior (methods).

```java
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.drive();
```

### Where It Fits:
- Forms the core of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.
- Everything in Java revolves around classes and objects.

### When and Why:
- Use when you need to model real-world entities (e.g., Student, BankAccount, etc.)
- Promotes **code reusability**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

## ðŸš¦ Code Examples With Progressive Complexity

### Beginner Level
```java
class Dog {
    String breed = "Labrador";
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof Woof!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.bark();
        System.out.println(d.breed);
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Level
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialDeposit) {
        this.balance = initialDeposit;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### Advanced Level
```java
class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Pitfalls:
- Forgetting to encapsulate data (use `private` + getters/setters).
- Creating multiple instances unnecessarily.
- Ignoring `final`, `static`, and access modifiers.

### Best Practices:
- Always initialize objects properly.
- Use **constructor overloading** where needed.
- Prefer composition over inheritance when applicable.
- Avoid public fields; use accessors.

## ðŸ’¡ Spring Boot Integration Example

### Business Use Case: Car Rental API
```java
@Entity
public class Car {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String model;
    private String status;

    // Getters and setters
}

@Repository
public interface CarRepository extends JpaRepository<Car, Long> {}

@Service
public class CarService {
    @Autowired
    private CarRepository repo;

    public Car rentCar(Long id) {
        Car car = repo.findById(id).orElseThrow();
        car.setStatus("rented");
        return repo.save(car);
    }
}
```

- Spring Boot leverages objects as **Beans**, classes as **Entities, Services**, etc.
- Uses **dependency injection** to manage object creation.

## ðŸ§  JDK vs JRE vs JVM

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
- Executes Java bytecode (.class files).
- Platform-dependent.
- Handles memory, garbage collection, security, etc.

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
- Contains JVM + libraries required to run Java applications.

### JDK (Java Development Kit):
- Includes JRE + compilers + tools (javac, javadoc, etc.) to develop Java apps.

```text
[JDK] = [JRE] + [Compiler, Debugger, Tools]
[JRE] = [JVM] + [Runtime Libraries]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is a class in Java?
**Answer:** A class is a template that defines data and behavior using fields and methods. Objects are created based on classes.

### 2. What is an object?
**Answer:** An object is an instance of a class. It has a unique identity, state, and behavior.

### 3. How are classes and objects related?
**Answer:** Classes define the blueprint; objects are created from it.

### 4. What is the JVM?
**Answer:** The Java Virtual Machine is responsible for executing Java bytecode.

### 5. What is the difference between JDK and JRE?
**Answer:** JDK is for development; JRE is for running Java apps.

### 6. How do you create an object in Java?
```java
ClassName obj = new ClassName();
```

### 7. What is the use of constructors?
**Answer:** Constructors initialize new objects with default or user-provided values.

### 8. Can we override a constructor?
**Answer:** No, constructors can't be overridden.

### 9. Explain constructor overloading.
**Answer:** Having multiple constructors with different parameters.

### 10. What is the Singleton pattern?
**Answer:** A design pattern ensuring only one object instance exists.

### 11. How does Spring Boot use classes and objects?
**Answer:** Spring Boot manages classes as beans, entities, controllers, etc.

### 12. What's the role of `@Autowired`?
**Answer:** Automatically injects object dependencies.

### 13. Difference between `new` keyword and DI?
**Answer:** `new` creates manually, DI lets Spring manage it.

### 14. Can a class be private in Java?
**Answer:** Only inner classes can be private.

### 15. What is encapsulation?
**Answer:** Wrapping data and methods into a single unit.

### 16. What is method overloading?
**Answer:** Defining methods with the same name but different parameters.

### 17. What is method overriding?
**Answer:** Redefining a method in subclass with same signature.

### 18. Is JVM platform-independent?
**Answer:** JVM is platform-dependent, but Java code is platform-independent.

### 19. What is the role of garbage collector?
**Answer:** Automatically deallocates unused objects.

### 20. Can you create object without `new`?
**Answer:** Yes, using reflection or deserialization.

## ðŸ§ª Code Challenges

### Challenge 1:
**Task:** Create a class `Rectangle` with width, height, and method `area()`.

```java
class Rectangle {
    int width, height;

    Rectangle(int w, int h) {
        this.width = w;
        this.height = h;
    }

    int area() {
        return width * height;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Area: " + r.area());
    }
}
```

### Challenge 2:
**Task:** Implement a thread-safe Singleton.
```java
public class SafeSingleton {
    private static final SafeSingleton instance = new SafeSingleton();

    private SafeSingleton() {}

    public static SafeSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ’¬ Demonstrating Deep Understanding
- Use diagrams to explain JVM-JDK-JRE relationship.
- Discuss how Spring Boot manages object lifecycles.
- Describe trade-offs of Singleton vs DI.
- Showcase debugging experience around object lifecycle, memory leaks.
- Compare constructor injection vs setter injection.
