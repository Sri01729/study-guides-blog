**Moneris Mock Interview Q&A - Sai Srinivas Alahari**

---

### **Q1: Tell me about your recent microservices project**

**A:**
"Sure Brian. In my last role, we migrated a monolithic energy monitoring application to a full Spring Boot microservices architecture.

We split the system into multiple services like:
- **Energy Ingestion Service** – received real-time energy data from IoT devices over REST APIs
- **Analytics Service** – processed the data and performed business logic
- **User Service** – managed user roles and dashboards

For **async communication**, we used **Apache Kafka** for real-time processing and also **AWS SNS/SQS** to ensure guaranteed delivery of notifications and data routing between services.

We deployed all services on **AWS EC2 instances**, containerized with Docker. Each service was monitored via Prometheus, and metrics were visualized in Grafana.

To maintain configurations, we used **Spring Cloud Config Server** backed by Git, so each environment had its own YAML profile and could be managed centrally.

For API testing, we used both **Postman** for REST and **SOAP UI** to validate legacy SOAP endpoints that were still part of our ecosystem."

---

### **Q2: How did you ensure observability in your services?**

**A:**
"All services exposed metrics via **Spring Boot Actuator** at `/actuator/prometheus`. These were scraped by **Prometheus**, and we used **Grafana** dashboards for real-time visualization.

For distributed tracing, we plugged in **Spring Cloud Sleuth** and **Grafana Tempo** to track cross-service latency, especially between the ingestion and analytics services."

---

### **Q3: How did you implement reliable communication in the system?**

**A:**
"We used **Kafka** where high-throughput and streaming was needed, such as with IoT sensor data.

But for internal system-to-system communication, especially events like ‘New User Registered’ or ‘Data Threshold Crossed’, we used **AWS SNS/SQS**. This allowed us to decouple producers and consumers, add retries, and easily fan out messages to multiple services."

---

### **Q4: Where did you host and manage deployments?**

**A:**
"We hosted services on **EC2 instances** using Docker containers. Initially, we used **Docker Compose** for local testing and later orchestrated deployments via EC2-based bash scripts. In future, I’d love to explore ECS or EKS for better scalability.

Our team also worked closely with DevOps to automate deployments, but I was hands-on with containerizing, updating environment configs, and monitoring service health post-deploy."

---

### **Q5: How did you manage configuration across environments?**

**A:**
"Managing configuration across all the microservices was simplified using **Spring Cloud Config Server**. We had a centralized Git repository where each service’s environment-specific configuration (like dev, QA, prod) was stored as a YAML file.

Spring Boot applications would fetch their config using their `spring.application.name`. This setup avoided hardcoding secrets and enabled easier updates across environments."

---

### **Q6: How did you test your APIs during development?**

**A:**
"We used **Postman** to test our REST APIs extensively during development and regression. For legacy SOAP APIs that still had to be supported, I used **SOAP UI** to create test cases and validate integration responses.

This ensured backward compatibility and minimized bugs during new deployments."

---

### **Q7: How did you ensure reliability in Kafka consumers?**

**A:**
"To make Kafka consumers reliable, we used Spring Boot’s `@KafkaListener` along with **acknowledgment modes** and **retry logic**. We also implemented **dead-letter queues (DLQ)** using Kafka to capture failed messages for later inspection.

This helped maintain data integrity across services and avoided message loss."
