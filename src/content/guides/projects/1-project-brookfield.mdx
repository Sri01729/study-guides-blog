# 🌱 Project Title: **EnergyIQ – Smart Energy Usage Dashboard**

## 🧩 Business Need:
Brookfield Renewable aimed to offer corporate customers real-time insights into their energy usage to promote sustainability and optimize power consumption. The existing legacy monitoring tools were outdated, non-scalable, and had performance bottlenecks.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation:
* **Architecture**: Microservices-based, containerized with Docker, deployed via AWS EC2 using CloudFormation.
* **Backend**:
  * Developed Spring Boot services with Java 11 to handle energy data ingestion, aggregation, and RESTful APIs.
  * Integrated Apache Kafka + SNS/SQS for high-volume, event-driven data pipelines (from energy meters).
  * Used RDBMS (PostgreSQL) for structured reporting and MongoDB for time-series data.
  * Applied OAuth2 for secure API access.
* **Frontend**:
  * Built a React.js-based dashboard to visualize real-time energy usage, carbon footprint, and cost trends.
  * Implemented reusable components to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
* **CI/CD**:
  * Jenkins + Docker + Git for CI/CD.
  * Introduced Canary deployments for stable rollouts.

## 👤 Your Role & Responsibilities:
* Spearheaded the migration from monolith to Spring Boot microservices.
* Created and secured APIs for energy usage data and alert generation.
* Built a performance monitoring module that detected hung threads and optimized load handling in multi-threaded APIs.
* Managed cloud deployment infrastructure using AWS EC2 and CloudFormation.

## 🧱 Challenges Overcome:
* **Challenge**: Data ingestion latency from IoT energy meters.
  * **Solution**: Used Kafka with async message handling (SNS + SQS) to decouple producer-consumer flow.
* **Challenge**: High server load causing timeouts.
  * **Solution**: Optimized DB queries, parallelized API processing, applied thread pool tuning in Spring Boot.

## 📈 Business Impact:
* Reduced operational cost by **20%** post migration from on-premise to AWS.
* Improved dashboard response time by **25%** using optimized APIs and front-end lazy loading.
* Enabled sustainability reporting for clients, increasing enterprise customer engagement.

## 📅 Timeline:
**7 months** (Nov 2023 – May 2024)

## 👥 Team & Collaboration:
* 6-member team: 2 frontend devs, 2 backend devs, 1 DevOps, 1 QA.
* Daily Scrum, 2-week Sprints, Jira for tracking.

## 🔁 Methodology:
Agile (Scrum), CI/CD-first culture with code reviews, retrospectives, and sprint demos.

# 🧠 Deep Dive: Understanding EnergyIQ Project Technologies

This guide breaks down the technical aspects of the mock project **"EnergyIQ – Smart Energy Usage Dashboard"** into beginner-friendly explanations so you can confidently discuss them in interviews.

---

## 1. **Microservices Architecture**

### 🔍 What it Means:
Instead of building one large application (monolith), the system is split into smaller, independent services that each handle a specific business function.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
It helps scale, deploy, and update individual components without affecting the whole system.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
To allow the energy ingestion, analytics, and user dashboard to work independently.

### 🔧 How It Solved the Problem:
Allowed Brookfield to modernize its system, making updates easier and reducing downtime.

### ❓ Possible Interview Questions:
- What are the advantages of microservices?
- How do services communicate with each other?

### 🤓 Analogy:
Think of a restaurant with separate chefs for pasta, pizza, and desserts. Each one can work and improve independently.

---

## 2. **Spring Boot with Java 11**

### 🔍 What it Means:
Spring Boot is a Java framework that simplifies backend application development by providing ready-to-use setups.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
Reduces boilerplate code, speeds up development, and makes REST API creation simple.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
For quick development of backend services with clean, testable code.

### 🔧 How It Solved the Problem:
Allowed fast creation of backend APIs to handle energy data securely and efficiently.

### ❓ Possible Interview Questions:
- What's the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
- How does Spring Boot simplify development?

### 🤓 Analogy:
Like using a cake mix instead of baking from scratch—Spring Boot gives you the essentials already set up.

---

## 3. **Apache Kafka + SNS/SQS for Messaging**

### 🔍 What it Means:
Kafka, SNS (Simple Notification Service), and SQS (Simple Queue Service) are tools to send data between services asynchronously.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
To handle large amounts of real-time data from energy meters without overwhelming the backend.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
Kafka for speed and reliability, SNS/SQS for integration with AWS services.

### 🔧 How It Solved the Problem:
Allowed real-time ingestion of data while avoiding system crashes due to data spikes.

### ❓ Possible Interview Questions:
- What's the difference between Kafka and SQS?
- Why use asynchronous messaging?

### 🤓 Analogy:
Like a mailroom. Instead of delivering messages directly, you drop them into boxes, and someone else picks them up when ready.

---

## 4. **React.js Dashboard**

### 🔍 What it Means:
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using components.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
Provides a dynamic and interactive experience for users.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
For its performance, reusability of components, and ease of maintenance.

### 🔧 How It Solved the Problem:
Enabled real-time data visualizations that help users understand their energy usage.

### ❓ Possible Interview Questions:
- What are React components?
- How does React handle state changes?

### 🤓 Analogy:
Think of React like Lego blocks—you build complex UI with reusable, independent pieces.

---

## 5. **AWS EC2 + CloudFormation**

### 🔍 What it Means:
EC2 = Cloud servers. CloudFormation = Blueprint to automate the creation of AWS resources.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
Provides scalable infrastructure and easy repeatable deployments.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
To automate deployment and scale up during high traffic.

### 🔧 How It Solved the Problem:
Ensured consistent deployment across environments and handled load effectively.

### ❓ Possible Interview Questions:
- What is EC2?
- How does CloudFormation help with infrastructure as code?

### 🤓 Analogy:
EC2 = renting a computer in the cloud. CloudFormation = your list of instructions to set up that computer every time.

---

## 6. **OAuth2 Authentication**

### 🔍 What it Means:
OAuth2 is a security standard that allows safe access without sharing passwords.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
To secure APIs and user data.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
It is industry-standard and trusted by major providers like Google and Facebook.

### 🔧 How It Solved the Problem:
Prevented unauthorized access to sensitive energy usage data.

### ❓ Possible Interview Questions:
- What is the OAuth2 flow?
- How is OAuth2 different from basic auth?

### 🤓 Analogy:
Think of OAuth2 like a valet key—it gives access without revealing your full credentials.

---

## 7. **Jenkins + Docker for CI/CD**

### 🔍 What it Means:
Jenkins automates building and testing code. Docker packages your app and its dependencies into containers.

### 🧠 Why It's Used:
CI/CD ensures frequent, reliable deployments. Docker guarantees "it works on my machine" everywhere.

### 💡 Why We Chose It:
To streamline development and ensure consistency from development to production.
